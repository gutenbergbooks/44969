<h4>Transcriber's Notes</h4>

<p>This book contains material in multiple languages, and numerous
examples of archaic, non-standard and dialect forms of English.
Therefore no attempts to standardize spelling would be appropriate.
The only changes made to the text are to correct typographical errors etc.
which are listed <a href="#Transcribers_Notes">at the end of the book</a>.
Minor corrections to format or punctuation have been made without comment.</p>

<p>Footnotes have been numbered sequentially throughout the book but are
presented at the end of each section or ballad to which they refer.</p>

<p>Unicode characters have been used
for special symbols and diacritics in the text. These should appear in
the following table:</p>


<div class="center">

<p>Greek symbols are also rendered with Unicode characters, but a Latin transliteration is provided in the "hover-text".</p>

<p>Note that [a'] and ['s] denote editorial insertions of contracted
forms: e.g. on page 299 [a'] is an editorial
insertion of "a'" (for "all"); on page 309 ['s] is an editorial

think, be beyond reach of man, yet exposed to destructive chances.

<h3><a name="ADVERTISEMENT_TO_PART_I" id="ADVERTISEMENT_TO_PART_I">ADVERTISEMENT TO PART I</a>
<br />
<small>NUMBERS 1-28</small></h3>


<p>It was my wish not to begin to print The English and Scottish Popular
Ballads until this unrestricted title should be justified by my having
at command every valuable copy of every known ballad. A continuous
effort to accomplish this object has been making for some nine or
ten years, and many have joined in it. By correspondence, and by an
extensive diffusion of printed circulars, I have tried to stimulate
collection from tradition in Scotland, Canada, and the United States,
and no becoming means has been left unemployed to obtain possession of
unsunned treasures locked up in writing. The gathering from tradition
has been, as ought perhaps to have been foreseen at this late day,
meagre, and generally of indifferent quality. Materials in the hands
of former editors have, in some cases, been lost beyond recovery,
and very probably have lighted fires, like that large cantle of the
Percy manuscript, <i>maxime deflendus</i>! Access to several manuscript
collections has not yet been secured. But what is still lacking is
believed to bear no great proportion to what is in hand, and may soon
come in, besides: meanwhile, the uncertainties of the world forbid a
longer delay to publish so much as has been got together.</p>

<p>Of hitherto unused materials, much the most important is a large
collection of ballads made by Motherwell. For leave to take a copy
of this I am deeply indebted to the present possessor, Mr Malcolm
Colquhoun Thomson, of Glasgow, who even allowed the manuscript
to be sent to London, and to be retained several months, for my
accommodation. Mr J. Wylie Guild, of Glasgow, also permitted the use
of a note-book of Motherwell's which supplements the great manuscript,
and this my unwearied friend, Mr James Barclay Murdoch, to whose
solicitation I owe both, himself transcribed with the most scrupulous
accuracy. No other good office, asked or unasked, has Mr Murdoch spared.</p>

<p>Next in extent to the Motherwell collections come those of the late
Mr Kinloch. These he freely placed at my disposal, and Mr William
Macmath, of Edinburgh, made during Mr Kinloch's life an exquisite copy
of the larger part of them, enriched with notes from Mr Kinloch's
papers, and sent it to me across the water. After Mr Kinloch's death
his collections were acquired by Harvard College Library, still through
the agency of Mr Macmath, who has from the beginning rendered a highly
valued assistance, not less by his suggestions and communications than
by his zealous mediation.</p>

<p>No Scottish ballads are superior in kind to those recited in the last
century by Mrs Brown, of Falkland. Of these there are, or were, three
sets. One formerly owned by Robert Jamieson, the fullest of the three,
was lent me, to keep as long as I required, by my honored friend the
late Mr David Laing, who also secured for me copies of several ballads
of Mrs Brown which are found in an Abbotsford manuscript, and gave me a
transcript of the Glenriddell manuscript. The two others were written
down for William Tytler and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span> Alexander Fraser Tytler respectively, the
former of these consisting of a portion of the Jamieson texts revised.
These having for some time been lost sight of, Miss Mary Fraser Tytler,
with a graciousness which I have reason to believe hereditary in the
name, made search for them, recovered the one which had been obtained
by Lord Woodhouselee, and copied it for me with her own hand. The same
lady furnished me with another collection which had been made by a
member of the family.</p>

<p>For later transcriptions from Scottish tradition I am indebted to Mr
J. F. Campbell of Islay, whose edition and rendering of the racy West
Highland Tales is marked by the rarest appreciation of the popular
genius; to Mrs A. F. Murison, formerly of Old Deer, who undertook a
quest for ballads in her native place on my behalf; to Mr Alexander
Laing, of Newburgh-upon-Tay; to Mr James Gibb, of Joppa, who has given
me a full score; to Mr David Louden, of Morham, Haddington; to the late
Dr John Hill Burton and Miss Ella Burton; to Dr Thomas Davidson.</p>

<p>The late Mr Robert White, of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, allowed me to look
through his collections in 1873, and subsequently made me a copy of
such things as I needed, and his ready kindness has been continued by
Mrs Andrews, his sister, and by Miss Andrews, his niece, who has taken
a great deal of trouble on my account.</p>

<p>In the south of the mother-island my reliance has, of necessity, been
chiefly upon libraries. The British Museum possesses, besides early
copies of some of the older ballads, the Percy MS., Herd's MSS and
Buchan's, and the Roxburgh broadsides. The library of the University of
Cambridge affords one or two things of first-rate importance, and for
these I am beholden to the accomplished librarian, Mr Henry Bradshaw,
and to Professor Skeat. I have also to thank the Rev. F. Gunton,
Dean, and the other authorities of Magdalen College, Cambridge, for
permitting collations of Pepys ballads, most obligingly made for me by
Mr Arthur S. B. Miller. Many things were required from the Bodleian
library, and these were looked out for me, and scrupulously copied or
collated, by Mr George Parker.</p>

<p>Texts of traditional ballads have been communicated to me in America
by Mr W. W. Newell, of New York, who is soon to give us an interesting
collection of Children's Games traditional in America; by Dr
Huntington, Bishop of Central New York; Mr G. C. Mahon, of Ann Arbor,
Michigan; Miss Margaret Reburn, of New Albion, Iowa; Miss Perine, of
Baltimore; Mrs Augustus Lowell, Mrs L. F. Wesselhoeft, Mrs. Edward
Atkinson, of Boston; Mrs Cushing, of Cambridge; Miss Ellen Marston, of
New Bedford; Mrs Moncrieff, of London, Ontario.</p>

<p>Acknowledgments not well despatched in a phrase are due to many others
who have promoted my objects: to Mr Furnivall, for doing for me
everything which I could have done for myself had I lived in England;
to that master of old songs and music, Mr William Chappell, very
specially; to Mr J. Payne Collier; Mr Norval Clyne, of Aberdeen; Mr
Alexander Young, of Glasgow; Mr Arthur Laurenson, of Lerwick, Shetland;
Mr J. Burrell Curtis, of Edinburgh; Dr Vigfusson, of Oxford; Professor
Edward Arber, of Birmingham; the Rev. J. Percival, Mr Francis Fry, Mr
J. F. Nicholls, of Bristol; Professor George Stephens, of Copenhagen;
Mr R. Bergström, of the Royal Library, Stockholm; Mr W. R. S. Ralston,
Mr William Henry Husk, Miss Lucy Toulmin Smith, Mr A. F. Murison, of
London; Professor Sophocles; Mr W. G. Medlicott, of Longmeadow; to Mr
M. Heilprin, of New York, Mme de Maltchycé, of Boston, and Rabbi Dr
Cohn, for indispensable translations from Polish and Hungarian; to
Mr James Russell Lowell, Minister of the United States at London; to
Professor Charles Eliot Norton, for such "pains and benefits" as I
could ask only of a life-long friend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span></p>

<p>In the editing of these ballads I have closely followed the plan of
Grundtvig's Old Popular Ballads of Denmark, a work which will be prized
highest by those who have used it most, and which leaves nothing to be
desired but its completion. The author is as much at home in English as
in Danish tradition, and whenever he takes up a ballad which is common
to both nations nothing remains to be done but to supply what has come
to light since the time of his writing. But besides the assistance
which I have derived from his book, I have enjoyed the advantage of
Professor Grundtvig's criticism and advice, and have received from him
unprinted Danish texts, and other aid in many ways.</p>

<p>Such further explanations as to the plan and conduct of the work as may
be desirable can be more conveniently given by and by. I may say here
that textual points which may seem to be neglected will be considered
in an intended Glossary, with which will be given a full account of
Sources, and such indexes of Titles and Matters as will make it easy to
find everything that the book may contain.</p>

<p>With renewed thanks to all helpers, and helpers' helpers, I would
invoke the largest coöperation for the correction of errors and the
supplying of deficiencies. To forestall a misunderstanding which has
often occurred, I beg to say that every traditional version of a
popular ballad is desired, no matter how many texts of the same may
have been printed already.</p>

<p>I have again to express my obligations and my gratitude to many who
have aided in the collecting and editing of these Ballads.</p>

<p>To Sir Hugh Hume Campbell, for the use of two considerable manuscript
volumes of Scottish Ballads.</p>

<p>To Mr Allardyce, of Edinburgh, for a copy of the Skene Ballads, and
for a generous permission to print such as I required, in advance of a
possible publication on his part.</p>

<p>To Mr Mansfield, of Edinburgh, for the use of the Pitcairn manuscripts.</p>

<p>To Mrs Robertson, for the use of Note-Books of the late Dr Joseph
Robertson, and to Mr Murdoch, of Glasgow, Mr Lugton, of Kelso, Mrs
Alexander Forbes, of Edinburgh, and Messrs G. L. Kittredge and G.
M. Richardson, former students of Harvard College, for various
communications.</p>

<p>To Dr Reinhold Köhler's unrivalled knowledge of popular fiction, and
his equal liberality, I am indebted for valuable notes, which will be
found in the Additions at the end of this volume.</p>

<p>The help of my friend Dr Theodor Vetter has enabled me to explore
portions of the Slavic ballad-field which otherwise must have been
neglected.</p>

<p>Professors D. Silvan Evans, John Rhys, Paul Meyer, and T. Frederick
Crane have lent me a ready assistance in literary emergencies.</p>

<p>The interest and coöperation of Mr Furnivall and Mr Macmath have been
continued to me without stint or weariness.</p>

<p>It is impossible, while recalling and acknowledging acts of courtesy,
good will, and friendship, not to allude, with one word of deep
personal grief, to the irreparable loss which all who are concerned
with the study of popular tradition have experienced in the death of
Svend Grundtvig.</p>

<h2><a name="FRANCIS_JAMES_CHILD" id="FRANCIS_JAMES_CHILD">FRANCIS JAMES CHILD</a></h2>

<p>Francis James Child was born in Boston on the first day of February,
1825. He was the third in a family of eight children. His father
was a sailmaker, "one of that class of intelligent and independent
mechanics," writes Professor Norton, "which has had a large share in
determining the character of our democratic community, as of old the
same class had in Athens and in Florence." The boy attended the public
schools, as a matter of course; and, his parents having no thought of
sending him to college, he went, in due time, not to the Latin School,
but to the English High School of his native town. At that time the
head master of the Boston Latin School was Mr Epes Sargent Dixwell, who
is still living, at a ripe old age, one of the most respected citizens
of Cambridge. Mr Dixwell had a keen eye for scholarly possibilities
in boys, and, falling in with young Francis Child, was immediately
struck with his extraordinary mental ability. At his suggestion, the
boy was transferred to the Latin School, where he entered upon the
regular preparation for admission to Harvard College. His delight in
his new studies was unbounded, and the freshness of it never faded from
his memory. "He speedily caught up with the boys who had already made
considerable progress in Greek and Latin, and soon took the first place
here, as he had done in the schools which he had previously attended."
Mr Dixwell strongly advised his father to permit him to continue his
studies, and made arrangements by which his college expenses should be
provided for. The money Professor Child repaid, with interest, as soon
as his means allowed. His gratitude to Mr. Dixwell and the friendship
between them lasted through his life.</p>

<p>In 1842 Mr Child entered Harvard College. The intellectual condition
of the college at that time and the undergraduate career of Mr Child
have been admirably described by his classmate and lifelong friend,
Professor Norton, in a passage which must be quoted in full<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Harvard was then still a comparatively small institution, with no
claims to the title of University; but she had her traditions of good
learning as an inspiration for the studious youth, and still better she
had teachers who were examples of devotion to intellectual pursuits,
and who cared for those ends the attainment of which makes life
worth living. Josiah Quincy was approaching the close of his term of
service as President of the College, and stood before the eyes of the
students as the type of a great public servant, embodying the spirit of
patriotism, of integrity, and of fidelity in the discharge of whatever
duty he might be called to perform. Among the Professors were Walker,
Felton, Peirce, Channing, Beck, and Longfellow, men of utmost variety
of temperament, but each an instructor who secured the respect no less
than the gratitude of his pupils.</p>

<p>"The class to which Child belonged numbered hardly over sixty. The
prescribed course of study which was then the rule brought all the
members of the class together in recitations and lectures, and every
man soon knew the relative standing of each of his fellows. Child at
once took the lead and kept it. His excellence was not confined to
any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[Pg xxiv]</a></span> one special branch of study; he was equally superior in all. He
was the best in the classics, he was Peirce's favorite in mathematics,
he wrote better English than any of his classmates. His intellectual
interests were wider than theirs, he was a great reader, and his tastes
in reading were mature. He read for amusement as well as for learning,
but he did not waste his time or dissipate his mental energies over
worthless or pernicious books. He made good use of the social no less
than of the intellectual opportunities which college life affords, and
became as great a favorite with his classmates as he had been with his
schoolfellows.</p>

<p>"The close of his college course was marked by the exceptional
distinction of his being chosen by his classmates as their Orator, and
by his having the first part at Commencement as the highest scholar
in the class. His class oration was remarkable for its maturity of
thought and of style. Its manliness of spirit, its simple directness
of presentation of the true objects of life, and of the motives by
which the educated man, whatever might be his chosen career, should be
inspired, together with the serious and eloquent earnestness with which
it was delivered, gave to his discourse peculiar impressiveness and
effect."</p>

<p>Graduating with the degree of Bachelor of Arts in 1846, Mr Child
immediately entered the service of the college, in which he continued
till the day of his death. From 1846 to 1848 he was tutor in
mathematics. In 1848 he was transferred, at his own request, to a
tutorship in history and political economy, to which were annexed
certain duties of instruction in English. In 1849 he obtained leave of
absence for travel and study in Europe. He remained in Europe for about
two years, returning, late in 1851, to receive an appointment to the
Boylston Professorship of Rhetoric and Oratory, then falling vacant by
the resignation of Professor Edward T. Channing.</p>

<p>The tutorships which Mr Child had held were not entirely in accordance
with his tastes, which had always led him in the direction of literary
and linguistic study. The faculty of the college was small, however,
and it was not always possible to assign an instructor to the
department that would have been most to his mind. But the governors
of the institution were glad to secure the services of so promising
a scholar; and Mr Child, whose preference for an academic career
was decided, had felt that it was wise to accept such positions as
the college could offer, leaving exacter adjustments to time and
circumstances. Meantime he had devoted his whole leisure to the pursuit
of his favorite studies. His first fruits were a volume entitled Four
Old Plays<a name="FNanchor_1_2" id="FNanchor_1_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> published in 1848, when he was but twenty-three years old.
This was a remarkably competent performance. The texts are edited with
judgment and accuracy; the introduction shows literary discrimination
as well as sound scholarship, and the glossary and brief notes are
thoroughly good. There are no signs of immaturity in the book, and it
is still valued by students of our early drama.</p>

<p>The leave of absence granted to Mr Child in 1849 came at a most
favorable moment. His health had suffered from close application to
work, and a change of climate had been advised by his physicians. His
intellectual and scholarly development, too, had reached that stage in
which foreign study and travel were certain to be most stimulating and
fruitful. He was amazingly apt, and two years of opportunity meant much
more to him than to most men. He returned to take up the duties of his
new office a trained and mature scholar, at home in the best methods
and traditions of German universities, yet with no sacrifice of his
individuality and intellectual independence.</p>

<p>While in Germany Mr Child studied at Berlin and Göttingen, giving his
time mostly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[Pg xxv]</a></span> to Germanic philology, then cultivated with extraordinary
vigor and success. The hour was singularly propitious. In the three
or four decades preceding Mr Child's residence in Europe, Germanic
philology (in the wider sense) had passed from the stage of "romantic"
dilettantism into the condition of a well-organized and strenuous
scientific discipline, but the freshness and vivacity of the first
half of the century had not vanished. Scholars, however severe, looked
through the form and strove to comprehend the spirit. The ideals
of erudition and of a large humanity were not even suspected of
incompatibility. The imagination was still invoked as the guide and
illuminator of learning. The bond between antiquity and mediævalism and
between the Middle Ages and our own century was never lost from sight.
It was certainly fortunate for American scholarship that at precisely
this juncture a young man of Mr Child's ardent love of learning, strong
individuality, and broad intellectual sympathies was brought into close
contact with all that was most quickening in German university life.
He attended lectures on classical antiquity and philosophy, as well as
on Germanic philology; but it was not so much by direct instruction
that he profited as by the inspiration which he derived from the spirit
and the ideals of foreign scholars, young and old. His own greatest
contribution to learning, The English and Scottish Popular Ballads, may
even, in a very real sense, be regarded as the fruit of these years in
Germany. Throughout his life he kept a picture of William and James
Grimm on the mantel over his study fireplace.</p>

<p>Mr Child wrote no "dissertation," and returned to Cambridge without
having attempted to secure a doctor's degree. Never eager for such
distinctions, he had been unwilling to subject himself to the
restrictions on his plan of study which candidacy for the doctorate
would have imposed. Three years after, however, in 1854, he was
surprised and gratified to receive from the University of Göttingen the
degree of Doctor of Philosophy, accompanied by a special tribute of
respect from that institution. Subsequently he received the degree of
LL. D. from Harvard (in 1884) and that of L. H. D. from Columbia (in
1887); but the Göttingen Ph. D., coming as it did at the outset of his
career, was in a high degree auspicious.</p>

<p>The Boylston Professorship of Rhetoric and Oratory, to which, as has
been already mentioned, Mr Child succeeded on his return to America
toward the end of 1851, was no sinecure. In addition to academic
instruction of the ordinary kind, the duties of the chair included the
superintendence and criticism of a great quantity of written work,
in the nature of essays and set compositions prepared by students
of all degrees of ability. For twenty-five years Mr Child performed
these duties with characteristic punctuality and devotion, though with
increasing distaste for the drudgery which they involved. Meantime a
great change had come over Harvard: it had developed from a provincial
college into a national seminary of learning, and the introduction
of the "elective system"&mdash;corresponding to the "Lernfreiheit" of
Germany&mdash;had enabled it to become a university in the proper sense of
the word. One result of the important reform just referred to was the
establishment of a Professorship of English, entirely distinct from the
old chair of Rhetoric. This took place on May 8, 1876, and on the 20th
of the next month Mr Child was transferred to the new professorship.
His duties as an instructor were now thoroughly congenial, and he
continued to perform them with unabated vigor to the end. In the
onerous details of administrative and advisory work, inseparable,
according to our exacting American system, from the position of a
university professor, he was equally faithful and untiring. For
thirty years he acted as secretary of the Library Council, and in all
that time he was absent from but three meetings. As chairman of the
Department of English and of the Division of Modern Languages, and
as a member of many important committees, he was ever prodigal of
time and effort. How steadily he attended to the regular duties of
the class-room, his pupils, for fifty years, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[Pg xxvi]</a></span> the best witnesses.
They, too, will best understand the satisfaction he felt that, in the
fiftieth year of his teaching, he was not absent from a single lecture.
No man was ever less a formalist; yet the most formal of natures could
not, in the strictest observance of punctilio, have surpassed the
regularity with which he discharged, as it were spontaneously, the
multifarious duties of his position.</p>

<p>Throughout his service as professor of rhetoric, Mr Child, hampered
though he was by the requirements of his laborious office, had
pursued with unquenchable ardor the study of the English language and
literature, particularly in their older forms, and in these subjects he
had become an authority of the first rank long before the establishment
of the English chair enabled him to arrange his university teaching
in accordance with his tastes. Soon after he returned from Germany he
undertook the general editorial supervision of a series of the 'British
Poets,' published at Boston in 1853 and several following years, and
extending to some hundred and fifty volumes. Out of this grew, in one
way or another, his three most important contributions to learning: his
edition of Spenser, his Observations on the Language of Chaucer and
Gower, and his English and Scottish Popular Ballads.</p>

<p>Mr Child's Spenser appeared in 1855.<a name="FNanchor_1_3" id="FNanchor_1_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Originally intended, as he says
in the preface, as little more than a reprint of the edition published
in 1839 under the superintendence of Mr George Hillard, the book grew
upon his hands until it had become something quite different from its
predecessor. Securing access to old copies of most of Spenser's poems,
Mr Child subjected the text to a careful revision, which left little
to be done in this regard. His Life of Spenser was far better than
any previous biography, and his notes, though brief, were marked by
a philological exactness to which former editions could not pretend.
Altogether, though meant for the general reader and therefore sparingly
annotated, Mr Child's volumes remain, after forty years, the best
edition of Spenser in existence.</p>

<p>The plan of the 'British Poets' originally contemplated an edition of
Chaucer, which Mr Child was to prepare. Becoming convinced, however,
that the time was not ripe for such a work, he abandoned this project,
and to the end of his life he never found time to resume it. Thomas
Wright's print of the Canterbury Tales<a name="FNanchor_1_4" id="FNanchor_1_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> from the Harleian MS. 7334
had, however, put into his hands a reasonably faithful reproduction of
an old text, and he turned his attention to a minute study of Chaucer's
language. The outcome was the publication, in the Memoirs of the
American Academy of Arts and Sciences for 1863, of the great treatise
to which Mr Child gave the modest title of Observations on the Language
of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. It is difficult, at the present day, to
imagine the state of Chaucer philology at the moment when this paper
appeared. Scarcely anything, we may say, was known of Chaucer's grammar
and metre in a sure and scientific way. Indeed, the difficulties
to be solved had not even been clearly formulated. Further, the
accessible mass of evidence on Anglo-Saxon and Middle English was,
in comparison with the stores now at the easy command of every tyro,
almost insignificant. Yet, in this brief treatise, Mr Child not only
defined the problems, but provided for most of them a solution which
the researches of younger scholars have only served to substantiate.
He also gave a perfect model of the method proper to such inquiries&mdash;a
method simple, laborious, and exact. The Observations were subsequently
rearranged and condensed, with Professor Child's permission, by Mr A.
J. Ellis for his work On Early English Pronunciation; but only those
who have studied them in their original form can appreciate their merit
fully. "It ought never to be forgotten," writes Pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[Pg xxvii]</a></span>fessor Skeat, "that
the only full and almost complete solution of the question of the right
scansion of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales is due to what Mr Ellis rightly
terms 'the wonderful industry, acuteness, and accuracy of Professor
Child.'" Had he produced nothing else, this work, with its pendant, the
Observations on Gower,<a name="FNanchor_1_5" id="FNanchor_1_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> would have assured him a high place among
those very few scholars who have permanently settled important problems
of linguistic science.</p>

<p>Mr Child's crowning work, however, was the edition of the English and
Scottish Popular Ballads, which the reader now has before him. The
history of this is the history of more than half a lifetime.</p>

<p>The idea of the present work grew out of Mr Child's editorial labors
on the series of the 'British Poets,' already referred to. For this he
prepared a collection in eight small volumes (1857-58) called English
and Scottish Ballads.<a name="FNanchor_1_6" id="FNanchor_1_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> This was marked by the beginnings of that
method of comparative study which is carried out to its ultimate issues
in the volumes of the present collection. The book circulated widely,
and was at once admitted to supersede all previous attempts in the
same field. To Mr Child, however, it was but the starting-point for
further researches. He soon formed the plan of a much more extensive
collection on an altogether different model. This was to include every
obtainable version of every extant English or Scottish ballad, with
the fullest possible discussion of related songs or stories in the
"popular" literature of all nations. To this enterprise he resolved,
if need were, to devote the rest of his life. His first care was
to secure trustworthy texts. In his earlier collection he had been
forced to depend almost entirely on printed books. No progress, he was
convinced, could be made till recourse could be had to manuscripts, and
in particular to the Percy MS. Accordingly he directed his most earnest
efforts to securing the publication of the entire contents of the
famous folio. The Percy MS. was at Ecton Hall, in the possession of the
Bishop's descendants, who would permit no one even to examine it. Two
attempts were made by Dr Furnivall, at Mr Child's instance, to induce
the owners to allow the manuscript to be printed,&mdash;one as early as 1860
or 1861, the other in 1864,&mdash;but without avail. A third attempt was
more successful, and in 1867-68 the long-secluded folio was made the
common property of scholars in an edition prepared by Professor Hales
and Dr Furnivall.<a name="FNanchor_1_7" id="FNanchor_1_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>The publication of the Percy MS. not only put a large amount of
trustworthy material at the disposal of Mr Child; it exposed the
full enormity of Bishop Percy's sins against popular tradition. Some
shadow of suspicion inevitably fell on all other ballad collections.
It was more than ever clear to Mr Child that he could not safely
take anything at second hand, and he determined not to print a line
of his projected work till he had exhausted every effort to get
hold of whatever manuscript material might be in existence. His
efforts in this direction continued through many years. A number of
manuscripts were in private hands; of some the whereabouts was not
known; of others the existence was not suspected. But Mr Child was
untiring. He was cordially assisted by various scholars, antiquaries,
and private gentlemen, to whose coöperation ample testimony is
borne in the Advertisements prefixed to the volumes in the present
work. Some manuscripts were secured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[Pg xxviii]</a></span> for the Library of Harvard
University&mdash;notably Bishop Percy's Papers, the Kinloch MSS, and
the Harris MS.,<a name="FNanchor_1_8" id="FNanchor_1_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>&mdash;and of others careful copies were made, which
became the property of the same library. In all these operations the
indispensable good offices of Mr William Macmath, of Edinburgh, deserve
particular mention. For a long series of years his services were always
at Mr Child's disposal. His self-sacrifice and generosity appear to
have been equalled only by his perseverance and wonderful accuracy.
But for him the manuscript basis of The English and Scottish Popular
Ballads would have been far less strong than it is.</p>

<p>Gradually, then, the manuscript materials came in, until at last, in
1882, Mr Child felt justified in beginning to print. Other important
documents were, however, discovered or made accessible as time went
on. Especially noteworthy was the great find at Abbotsford (see the
Advertisement to Part VIII). In 1877 Dr David Laing procured, "not
without difficulty," leave to prepare for Mr Child a copy of the
single manuscript of ballads then known to remain in the library at
Abbotsford. This MS., entitled "Scottish Songs," was so inconsiderable,
in proportion to the accumulations which Sir Walter Scott had made
in preparing his Border Minstrelsy, that further search seemed to be
imperatively necessary. In 1890 permission to make such a search, and
to use the results, was given by the Honorable Mrs Maxwell-Scott. The
investigation, made by Mr Macmath, yielded a rich harvest of ballads,
which were utilized in Parts VII-IX. To dwell upon the details would
be endless. The reader may see a list of the manuscript sources at pp.
397 ff. of the fifth volume; and, if he will observe how scattered
they were, he will have no difficulty in believing that it required
years, labor, and much delicate negotiation to bring them all together.
One manuscript remained undiscoverable, William Tytler's Brown MS.,
but there is no reason to believe that this contained anything of
consequence that is not otherwise known.<a name="FNanchor_1_9" id="FNanchor_1_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, concurrently with the toil of amassing, collating, and
arranging texts, went on the far more arduous labor of comparative
study of the ballads of all nations; for, in accordance with Mr
Child's plan it was requisite to determine, in the fullest manner,
the history and foreign relations of every piece included in his
collection. To this end he devoted much time and unwearied diligence
to forming, in the Library of the University, a special collection of
"Folk-lore," particularly of ballads, romances, and <i>Märchen</i>. This
priceless collection, the formation of which must be looked on as one
of Mr Child's most striking services to the university, numbers some
7000 volumes. But these figures by no means represent the richness
of the Library in the departments concerned, or the services of Mr
Child in this particular. Mediæval literature in all its phases was
his province, and thousands of volumes classified in other departments
of the University Library bear testimony to his vigilance in ordering
books, and his astonishing bibliographical knowledge. Very few books
are cited in the present collection which are not to be found on the
shelves of this Library.</p>

<p>In addition, Mr Child made an effort to stimulate the collection of
such remains of the traditional ballad as still live on the lips of
the people in this country and in the British Islands. The harvest
was, in his opinion, rather scanty; yet, if all the versions thus
recovered from tradition were enumerated, the number would not be found
inconsiderable. Enough was done, at all events, to make it clear that
little or nothing of value remains to be recovered in this way.</p>

<p>To readers familiar with such studies, no comment is necessary, and to
those who are unfamiliar with them, no form of statement can convey
even a faint impression of the industry, the learning, the acumen,
and the literary skill which these processes required. In writing
the history of a single ballad, Mr Child was sometimes forced to
examine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[Pg xxix]</a></span> hundreds of books in perhaps a dozen different languages.
But his industry was unflagging, his sagacity was scarcely ever at
fault, and his linguistic and literary knowledge seemed to have no
bounds. He spared no pains to perfect his work in every detail, and
his success was commensurate with his efforts. In the Advertisement to
the Ninth Part (1894), he was able to report that the three hundred
and five numbers of his collection comprised the whole extant mass of
this traditional material, with the possible exception of a single
ballad.<a name="FNanchor_1_10" id="FNanchor_1_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>In June, 1896, Mr Child concluded his fiftieth year of service as
a teacher in Harvard College. He was at this time hard at work on
the Tenth and final Part, which was to contain a glossary, various
indexes, a bibliography, and an elaborate introduction on the general
subject. For years he had allowed himself scarcely any respite from
work, and, in spite of the uncertain condition of his health,&mdash;or
perhaps in consequence of it,&mdash;he continued to work at high pressure
throughout the summer. At the end of August he discovered that he was
seriously ill. He died at Boston on the 11th day of September. He had
finished his great work except for the introduction and the general
bibliography. The bibliography was in preparation by another hand and
has since been completed. The introduction, however, no other scholar
had the hardihood to undertake. A few pages of manuscript,&mdash;the last
thing written by his pen,&mdash;almost illegible, were found among his
papers to show that he had actually begun the composition of this
essay, and many sheets of excerpts testified to the time he had spent
in refreshing his memory as to the opinions of his predecessors, but
he had left no collectanea that could be utilized in supplying the
Introduction itself. He was accustomed to carry much of his material
in his memory till the moment of composition arrived, and this habit
accounts for the fact that there are no jottings of opinions and no
sketch of precisely what line of argument he intended to take.</p>

<p>Mr Child's sudden death was felt as a bitter personal loss, not only
by an unusually large circle of attached friends in both hemispheres,
but by very many scholars who knew him through his works alone. He was
one of the few learned men to whom the old title of "Master" was justly
due and freely accorded. With astonishing erudition, which nothing
seemed to have escaped, he united an infectious enthusiasm and a power
of lucid and fruitful exposition that made him one of the greatest of
teachers, and a warmth and openness of heart that won the affection
of all who knew him. In most men, however complex their characters,
one can distinguish the qualities of the heart, in some degree, from
the qualities of the head. In Professor Child no such distinction was
possible, for all the elements of his many-sided nature were fused in
his marked and powerful individuality. In his case, the scholar and the
man cannot be separated. His life and his learning were one; his work
was the expression of himself.</p>

<p>As an investigator Professor Child was at once the inspiration and
the despair of his disciples. Nothing could surpass the scientific
exactness of his methods and the unwearied diligence with which he
conducted his researches. No possible source of information could elude
him; no book or manuscript was too voluminous or too unpromising for
him to examine on the chance of its containing some fact that might
correct or supplement his material, even in the minutest point. Yet
these qualities of enthusiastic accuracy and thoroughness, admirable
as they undoubtedly were, by no means dominated him. They were always
at the command of the higher qualities of his genius,&mdash;sagacity,
acumen, and a kind of sympathetic and imaginative power in which
he stood almost alone among recent scholars. No detail of language
or tradition or archæology was to him a mere lifeless fact; it was
transmuted into something vital, and became a part of that universal
humanity which always moved him wherever he found it, whether in the
pages of a mediæval<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[Pg xxx]</a></span> chronicle, or in the stammering accents of a late
and vulgarly distorted ballad, or in the faces of the street boys who
begged roses from his garden. No man ever felt a keener interest in his
kind, and no scholar ever brought this interest into more vivifying
contact with the technicalities of his special studies. The exuberance
of this large humanity pervades his edition of the English and Scottish
ballads. Even in his last years, when the languor of uncertain health
sometimes got the better, for a season, of the spirit with which he
commonly worked, some fresh bit of genuine poetry in a ballad, some
fine trait of pure nature in a stray folk-tale, would, in an instant,
bring back the full flush of that enthusiasm which he must have felt
when the possibilities of his achievement first presented themselves to
his mind in early manhood. For such a nature there was no old age.</p>

<p>From this ready sympathy came that rare faculty&mdash;seldom possessed by
scholars&mdash;which made Professor Child peculiarly fit for his greatest
task. Few persons understand the difficulties of ballad investigation.
In no field of literature have the forger and the manipulator worked
with greater vigor and success. From Percy's day to our own it has been
thought an innocent device to publish a bit of one's own versifying,
now and then, as an "old ballad" or an "ancient song." Often, too,
a late stall-copy of a ballad, getting into oral circulation, has
been innocently furnished to collectors as traditional matter. Mere
learning will not guide an editor through these perplexities. What
is needed is, in addition, a complete understanding of the "popular"
genius, a sympathetic recognition of the traits that characterize oral
literature wherever and in whatever degree they exist. This faculty,
which even the folk has not retained, and which collectors living in
ballad-singing and tale-telling times have often failed to acquire,
was vouchsafed by nature herself to this sedentary scholar. In reality
a kind of instinct, it had been so cultivated by long and loving
study of the traditional literature of all nations that it had become
wonderfully swift in its operations and almost infallible. A forged or
retouched piece could not deceive him for a moment; he detected the
slightest jar in the genuine ballad tone. He speaks in one place of
certain writers "who would have been all the better historians for a
little reading of romances." He was himself the better interpreter of
the poetry of art for this keen sympathy with the poetry of nature.</p>

<p>Constant association with the spirit of the folk did its part in
maintaining, under the stress of unremitting study and research, that
freshness and buoyancy of mind which was the wonder of all who met
Professor Child for the first time, and the perpetual delight of his
friends and associates. It is impossible to describe the charm of his
familiar conversation. There was endless variety without effort. His
peculiar humor, taking shape in a thousand felicities of thought and
phrase that fell casually and as it were inevitably from his lips,
exhilarated without reaction or fatigue. His lightest words were
full of fruitful suggestion. Sudden strains of melancholy or high
seriousness were followed, in a moment, by flashes of gaiety almost
boyish. And pervading it all one felt the attraction of his personality
and the goodness of his heart.</p>

<p>Professor Child's humor was not only one of his most striking
characteristics as a man; it was of constant service to his scholarly
researches. Keenly alive to any incongruity in thought or fact, and the
least self-conscious of men, he scrutinized his own nascent theories
with the same humorous shrewdness with which he looked at the ideas
of others. It is impossible to think of him as the sponsor of some
hypotheses which men of equal eminence have advanced and defended
with passion; and, even if his goodness of nature had not prevented
it, his sense of the ridiculous would not have suffered him to engage
in the absurdities of philological polemics. In the interpretation
of literature, his humor stood him in good stead, keeping his native
sensibility under due control, so that it never degenerated into
sentimentalism. It made him a marvelous interpreter of Chaucer, whose
spirit he had caught to a degree attained by no other scholar or
critic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[Pg xxxi]</a></span></p>

<p>To younger scholars Professor Child was an influence at once
stimulating and benignant. To confer with him was always to be stirred
to greater effort, but, at the same time, the serenity of his devotion
to learning chastened the petulance of immature ambition in others. The
talk might be quite concrete, even definitely practical,&mdash;it might deal
with indifferent matters; but, in some way, there was an irradiation
of the master's nature that dispelled all unworthy feelings. In the
presence of his noble modesty the bustle of self-assertion was quieted
and the petty spirit of pedantic wrangling could not assert itself.
However severe his criticism, there were no personalities in it. He
could not be other than outspoken,&mdash;concealment and shuffling were
abhorrent to him,&mdash;yet such was his kindliness that his frankest
judgments never wounded; even his reproofs left no sting. With his
large charity was associated, as its necessary complement in a strong
character, a capacity for righteous indignation. "He is almost the
only man I know," said one in his lifetime, "who <i>thinks no evil</i>."
There could be no truer word. Yet when he was confronted with injury or
oppression, none could stand against the anger of this just man. His
unselfishness did not suffer him to see offences against himself, but
wrong done to another roused him in an instant to protesting action.</p>

<p>Professor Child's publications, despite their magnitude and importance,
are no adequate measure either of his acquirements or of his influence.
He printed nothing about Shakspere, for example, yet he was the peer
of any Shaksperian, past or present, in knowledge and interpretative
power. As a Chaucer scholar he had no superior, in this country or in
Europe: his published work was confined, as we have seen, to questions
of language, but no one had a wider or closer acquaintance with the
whole subject. An edition of Chaucer from his hand would have been
priceless. His acquaintance with letters was not confined to special
authors or centuries. He was at home in modern European literature
and profoundly versed in that of the Middle Ages. In his immediate
territory,&mdash;English,&mdash;his knowledge, linguistic and literary, covered
all periods, and was alike exact and thorough. His taste and judgment
were exquisite, and he enlightened every subject which he touched.
As a writer, he was master of a singularly felicitous style, full of
individuality and charm. Had his time not been occupied in other ways,
he would have made the most delightful of essayists.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Professor Child's courses of instruction in the
university&mdash;particularly those on Chaucer and Shakspere&mdash;gave him an
opportunity to impart to a constantly increasing circle of pupils the
choicest fruits of his life of thought and study. In his later years
he had the satisfaction to see grow up about him a school of young
specialists who can have no higher ambition than to be worthy of their
master. But his teaching was not limited to these,&mdash;it included all
sorts and conditions of college students; and none, not even the idle
and incompetent, could fail to catch something of his spirit. One thing
may be safely asserted: no university teacher was ever more beloved.</p>

<p>And with this may fitly close too slight a tribute to the memory of a
great scholar and a good man. Many things remain unsaid. His gracious
family life, his civic virtues, his patriotism, his bounty to the
poor,&mdash;all must be passed by with a bare mention, which yet will
signify much to those who knew him. In all ways he lived worthily, and
he died having attained worthy ends.</p>

<p>The four copies of <b>A</b> differ but very slightly: <b>a</b>,
<b>b</b>, <b>c</b> are broadsides, and <b>d</b> is evidently of that
derivation, <b>a</b> and <b>b</b> are of the 17th century. There is
another broadside in the Euing collection, formerly Halliwell's, No
253. The version in The Borderer's Table Book, <span class="smcap">VII</span>, 83, was
compounded by Dixon from others previously printed.</p>

<p>Riddles, as is well known, play an important part in popular story, and
that from very remote times. No one needs to be reminded of Samson,
&#338;dipus, Apollonius of Tyre. Riddle-tales, which, if not so old as
the oldest of these, may be carried in all likelihood some centuries
beyond our era, still live in Asiatic and European tradition, and have
their representatives in popular ballads. The largest class of these
tales is that in which one party has to guess another's riddles, or two
rivals compete in giving or guessing, under penalty in either instance
of forfeiting life or some other heavy wager; an example of which is
the English ballad, modern in form, of 'King John and the Abbot of
Canterbury.' In a second class, a suitor can win a lady's hand only
by guessing riddles, as in our '<a href="#Ballad_46">Captain Wedderburn's Courtship</a>' and
'<a href="#Ballad_47">Proud Lady Margaret.</a>' There is sometimes a penalty of loss of life
for the unsuccessful, but not in these ballads. Thirdly, there is the
tale (perhaps an offshoot of an early form of the first) of The Clever
Lass, who wins a husband, and sometimes a crown, by guessing riddles,
solving difficult but practicable problems, or matching and evading
impossibilities; and of this class versions <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> of
the present ballad and <b>A-H</b> of the following are specimens.</p>

<p>Ballads like our 1, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, 2, <b>A-H</b>, are very common
in <b>German</b>. Of the former variety are the following:</p>

<p><b>A.</b> 'Räthsellied,' Büsching, Wöchentliche Nachrichten,
<span class="smcap">I</span>, 65, from the neighborhood of Stuttgart. The same, Erlach,
<span class="smcap">III</span>, 37; Wunderhorn, <span class="smcap">IV</span>, 139; Liederhort, p. 338, No
153; Erk u. Irmer, H. 5, p. 32, No 29; Mittler, No 1307 (omits the last
stanza); Zuccalmaglio, <span class="smcap">II</span>, 574, No 317 [with change in st.
11]. A knight meets a maid on the road, dismounts, and says, "I will
ask you a riddle; if you guess it, you shall be my wife." She answers,
"Your riddle shall soon be guessed; I will do my best to be your wife;"
guesses eight pairs of riddles, is taken up behind him, and they ride
off. <b>B.</b> 'Räthsel um Räthsel,' Wunderhorn, <span class="smcap">II</span>, 407 [429,
418] == Erlach, <span class="smcap">I</span>, 439. Zuccalmaglio, <span class="smcap">II</span>, 572, No 316,
rearranges, but adds nothing. Mittler, No 1306, inserts three stanzas
(7, 9, 10). This version begins: "Maid, I will give you some riddles,
and if you guess them will marry you." There are seven pairs, and,
these guessed, the man says, "I can't give you riddles; let's marry;"
to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-2" id="Pg_1-2">[Pg 2]</a></span> which she gives no coy assent: but this conclusion is said not to
be genuine (Liederhort, p. 341, note). <b>C.</b> 'Räthsellied,' Erk,
Neue Sammlung, Heft 3, p. 64, No 57, and Liederhort, 340, No 153<sup>a</sup>
two Brandenburg versions, nearly agreeing, one with six, the other with
five, pairs of riddles. A proper conclusion not having been obtained,
the former was completed by the two last stanzas of <b>B</b>, which are
suspicious. <b>C</b> begins like <b>B</b>. <b>D.</b> 'Räthselfragen,'
Peter, Volksthümliches aus Österreichisch-Schlesien, <span class="smcap">I</span>,
272, No 83. A knight rides by where two maids are sitting, one of
whom salutes him, the other not. He says to the former, "I will put
you three questions, and if you can answer them will marry you." He
asks three, then six more, then three, and then two, and, all being
answered, bids her, since she is so witty, build a house on a needle's
point, and put in as many windows as there are stars in the sky; which
she parries with, "When all streams flow together, and all trees shall
fruit, and all thorns bear roses, then come for your answer." <b>E.</b>
'Räthsellied,' Tschischka u. Schottky, Oesterreichische Volkslieder,
2d ed., p. 28, begins like <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, has only three pairs of
riddles, and ends with the same task of building a house on a needle's
point. <b>F.</b> 'Räthsellied,' Hocker, Volkslieder von der Mosel, in
Wolf's Zeits. für deutsche Myth., <span class="smcap">I</span>, 251, from Trier, begins
with the usual promise, has five pairs of riddles, and no conclusion.
<b>G.</b> 'Räthsel,' Ditfurth, Fränkische V. L., <span class="smcap">II</span>, 110, No
146, has the same beginning, six pairs of riddles, and no conclusion.</p>

<p>Some of the riddles occur in nearly all the versions, some in only one
or two, and there is now and then a variation also in the answers.
Those which are most frequent are:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Which is the maid without a tress? <b>A-D</b>, <b>G</b>.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And which is the tower without a crest? <b>A-D</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">(Maid-child in the cradle; tower of Babel.)<br /></span>

<p>A ballad translated in Ralston's Songs of the Russian People, p. 356,
from Buslaef's Historical Sketches of National Literature and Art,
<span class="smcap">I</span>, 31, resembles very closely German <b>A</b>. A merchant's
son drives by a garden where a girl is gathering flowers. He salutes
her; she returns her thanks. Then the ballad proceeds:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Shall I ask thee riddles, beauteous maiden?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Six wise riddles shall I ask thee?'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Ask them, ask them, merchant's son,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Also, maiden, what is thicker than the forest?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Also, maiden, what is there that's rootless?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Also, maiden, what is never silent?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Also, what is there past finding out?'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'I will answer, merchant's son, will answer,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Never silent, merchant's son, the sea;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And God's will is past all finding out.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Thou hast guessed, O maiden fair, guessed rightly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All the six wise riddles hast thou answered;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore now to me shalt thou be wedded,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Among the Gaels, both Scotch and Irish, a ballad of the same
description is extremely well known. Apparently only the questions
are preserved in verse, and the connection with the story made by a
prose comment. Of these questions there is an Irish form, dated 1738,
which purports to be copied from a manuscript of the twelfth century.
Fionn would marry no lady whom he could pose. Graidhne, "daughter of
the king of the fifth of Ullin," answered everything he asked, and
became his wife. Altogether there are thirty-two questions in the
several versions. Among them are: What is blacker than the raven?
(There is death.) What is whiter than the snow? (There is the truth.)
'Fionn's Questions,' Campbell's Popular Tales of the West Highlands,
<span class="smcap">III</span>, 36; 'Fionn's Conversation with Ailbhe,'Heroic Gaelic
Ballads, by the same, pp. 150, 151.</p>

<p>The familiar ballad-knight of <b>A</b>, <b>B</b> is converted in
<b>C</b> into an "unco knicht," who is the devil, a departure from
the proper story which is found also in <b>2 J</b>. The conclusion of
<b>C</b>,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As soon as she the fiend did name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He flew awa in a blazing flame,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>reminds us of the behavior of trolls and nixes under like
circumstances, but here the naming amounts to a detection of the Unco
Knicht's quiddity, acts as an exorcism, and simply obliges the fiend to
go off in his real character. <b>D</b> belongs with <b>C</b>: it was
given by the reciter as a colloquy between the devil and a maiden.</p>

<p>The earlier affinities of this ballad can be better shown in connection
with No 2.</p>

<p>Pinkerton gave the first information concerning <b>A</b>, in Ancient
Scotish Poems ... from the MS. collections of Sir Richard Maitland,
etc., <span class="smcap">II</span>, 496, and he there printed the first and last stanzas
of the broadside. Motherwell printed the whole in the appendix to his
Minstrelsy, No I. What stands as the last stanza in the broadside is
now prefixed to the ballad, as having been the original burden. It is
the only example, so far as I remember, which our ballads afford of a
burden of this kind, one that is of greater extent than the stanza with
which it was sung, though this kind of burden seems to have been common
enough with old songs and carols.<a name="FNanchor_1_13" id="FNanchor_1_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>The 'Bridal Sark,' Cromek's Remains of Nithsdale and Galloway Song, p.
108, and 'The Bridegroom Darg,' p. 113, are of modern manufacture and
impostures; at least, they seem to have imposed upon Cromek.</p>

<p>A like ballad is very common in German. A man would take, or keep, a
woman for his love or his wife [servant, in one case], if she would
spin brown silk from oaten straw. She will do this if he will make
clothes for her of the linden-leaf. Then she must bring him shears
from the middle of the Rhine. But first he must build her a bridge
from a single twig, etc., etc. To this effect, with some variations

<p>The Graidhne whom we have seen winning Fionn for husband by guessing
his riddles, p. 3, afterwards became enamored of Diarmaid, Fionn's
nephew, in consequence of her accidentally seeing a beauty spot on
Diarmaid's forehead. This had the power of infecting with love any
woman whose eye should light upon it: wherefore Diarmaid used to wear
his cap well down. Graidhne tried to make Diarmaid run away with
her. But he said, "I will not go with thee. I will not take thee in
softness, and I will not take thee in hardness; I will not take thee
without, and I will not take thee within; I will not take thee on
horseback, and I will not take thee on foot." Then he went and built
himself a house where he thought he should be out of her way. But
Graidhne found him out. She took up a position between the two sides
of the door, on a buck goat, and called to him to go with her. For,
said she, "I am not without, I am not within; I am not on foot, and
I am not on a horse; and thou must go with me." After this Diarmaid
had no choice. 'Diarmaid and Grainne,' Tales of the West Highlands,
<span class="smcap">III</span>, 39-49; 'How Fingal got Graine to be his wife, and she
went away with Diarmaid,' Heroic Gaelic Ballads, p. 153; 'The Death of
Diarmaid,' ib., p. 154. The last two were written down c. 1774.</p>

<p>In all stories of the kind, the person upon whom a task is imposed
stands acquitted, if another of no less difficulty is devised which
must be performed first. This preliminary may be something that is
essential for the execution of the other, as in the German ballads, or
equally well something that has no kind of relation to the original
requisition, as in the English ballads.</p>

<p>An early form of such a story is preserved in Gesta Romanorum, c. 64,
Oesterley, p. 374. It were much to be wished that search were made for
a better copy, for, as it stands, this tale is to be interpreted only
by the English ballad. The old English version, Madden, <span class="smcap">XLIII</span>,
p. 142, is even worse mutilated than the Latin. A king, who was
stronger, wiser, and handsomer than any man, delayed, like the Marquis
of Saluzzo, to take a wife. His friends urged him to marry, and he
replied to their expostulations, "You know I am rich enough and
powerful enough; find me a maid who is good looking and sensible, and
I will take her to wife, though she be poor." A maid was found who was
eminently good looking and sensible, and of royal blood besides. The
king wished to make trial of her sagacity, and sent her a bit of linen
three inches square, with a promise to marry her if she would make him
a shirt of this, of proper length and width. The lady stipulated that
the king should send her "a vessel in which she could work," and she
would make the shirt: "michi vas concedat in quo operari potero, et
camisiam satis longam ei promitto." So the king sent "vas debitum et
preciosum," the shirt was made, and the king married her.<a name="FNanchor_1_14" id="FNanchor_1_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> It may be
doubted whether the sagacious maid did not, in the unmutilated story,
deal with the problem as is done in a Transylvanian tale, Haltrich,
Deutsche Volksmärchen, u.s.w., No 45, p. 245, where the king requires
the maid to make a shirt and drawers of two threads. The maid, in this
instance, sends the king a couple of broomsticks, requiring that he
should first make her a loom and bobbin-wheel out of them.</p>

<p>The tale just cited, 'Der Burghüter und seine kluge Tochter,' is one
of several which have been obtained from tradition in this century,
that link the ballads of The Clever Lass with oriental stories of
great age. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-9" id="Pg_1-9">[Pg 9]</a></span> material points are these. A king requires the people
of a parish to answer three questions, or he will be the destruction
of them all: What is the finest sound, the finest song, the finest
stone? A poor warder is instructed by his daughter to reply, the ring
of bells, the song of the angels, the philosopher's stone. "Right,"
says the king, "but that never came out of your head. Confess who told
you, or a dungeon is your doom." The man owns that he has a clever
daughter, who had told him what to say. The king, to prove her sagacity
further, requires her to make a shirt and drawers of two threads, and
she responds in the manner just indicated. He next sends her by her
father an earthen pot with the bottom out, and tells her to sew in a
bottom so that no seam or stitch can be seen. She sends her father
back with a request that the king should first turn the pot inside
out, for cobblers always sew on the inside, not on the out. The king
next demanded that the girl should come to him, neither driving, nor
walking, nor riding; neither dressed nor naked; neither out of the road
nor in the road; and bring him something that was a gift and no gift.
She put two wasps between two plates, stripped, enveloped herself in a
fishing net, put her goat into the rut in the road, and, with one foot
on the goat's back, the other stepping along the rut, made her way to
the king. There she lifted up one of the plates, and the wasps flew
away: so she had brought the king a present and yet no present. The
king thought he could never find a shrewder woman, and married her.</p>

<p>Of the same tenor are a tale in Zingerle's Tyrolese Kinder u.
Hausmärchen, 'Was ist das Schönste, Stärkste und Reichste?' No 27, p.
162, and another in the Colshorns' Hanoverian Märchen u. Sagen, 'Die
kluge Dirne,' No 26, p. 79. Here a rich and a poor peasant [a farmer
and his bailiff] have a case in court, and wrangle till the magistrate,
in his weariness, says he will give them three questions, and whichever
answers right shall win. The questions in the former tale are: What is
the most beautiful, what the strongest, what the richest thing in the
world? In the other, What is fatter than fat? How heavy is the moon?
How far is it to heaven? The answers suggested by the poor peasant's
daughter are: Spring is the most beautiful of things, the ground the
strongest, autumn the richest. And the bailiff's daughter answers: The
ground is fatter than fat, for out of it comes all that's fat, and this
all goes back again; the moon has four quarters, and four quarters make
a pound; heaven is only one day's journey, for we read in the Bible,
"Today shalt thou be with me in Paradise." The judge sees that these
replies are beyond the wit of the respondents, and they own to having
been prompted by a daughter at home. The judge then says that if the
girl will come to him neither dressed nor naked, etc., he will marry
her; and so the shrewd wench becomes a magistrate's wife.</p>

<p>'Die kluge Bauerntochter,' in the Grimms' K. u. H. märchen, No 94, and
'Die kluge Hirtentochter,' in Pröhle's Märchen für die Jugend, No 49,
p. 181, afford another variety of these tales. A peasant, against the
advice of his daughter, carries the king a golden mortar, as he had
found it, without any pestle. The king shuts him up in prison till
he shall produce the pestle [Grimms]. The man does nothing but cry,
"Oh, that I had listened to my daughter!" The king sends for him, and,
learning what the girl's counsel had been, says he will give her a
riddle, and if she can make it out will marry her. She must come to him
neither clothed nor naked, neither riding nor driving, etc. The girl
wraps herself in a fishing net [Grimms, in bark, Pröhle], satisfies the
other stipulations also, and becomes a queen.<a name="FNanchor_1_15" id="FNanchor_1_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>Another story of the kind, and very well preserved, is No 25 of Vuk's
Volksmärchen der Serben, 'Von dem Mädchen das an Weisheit den Kaiser
übertraf,' p. 157. A poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-10" id="Pg_1-10">[Pg 10]</a></span> man had a wise daughter. An emperor gave him
thirty eggs, and said his daughter must hatch chickens from these, or
it would go hard with her. The girl perceived that the eggs had been
boiled. She boiled some beans, and told her father to be ploughing
along the road, and when the emperor came in sight, to sow them and
cry, "God grant my boiled beans may come up!" The emperor, hearing
these ejaculations, stopped, and said, "My poor fellow, how <i>can</i>
boiled beans grow?" The father answered, according to instructions, "As
well as chickens can hatch from boiled eggs." Then the emperor gave
the old man a bundle of linen, and bade him make of it, on pain of
death, sails and everything else requisite for a ship. The girl gave
her father a piece of wood, and sent him back to the emperor with the
message that she would perform what he had ordered, if he would first
make her a distaff, spindle, and loom out of the wood. The emperor was
astonished at the girl's readiness, and gave the old man a glass, with
which she was to drain the sea. The girl dispatched her father to the
emperor again with a pound of tow, and asked him to stop the mouths of
all the rivers that flow into the sea; then she would drain it dry.
Hereupon the emperor ordered the girl herself before him, and put her
the question, "What is heard furthest?" "Please your Majesty," she
answered, "thunder and lies." The emperor then, clutching his beard,
turned to his assembled counsellors, and said, "Guess how much my beard
is worth." One said so much, another so much. But the girl said, "Nay,
the emperor's beard is worth three rains in summer." The emperor took
her to wife.</p>

<p>With these traditional tales we may put the story of wise Petronelle
and Alphonso, king of Spain, told after a chronicle, with his usual
prolixity, by Gower, Confessio Amantis, Pauli, <span class="smcap">I</span>, 145 ff. The
king valued himself highly for his wit, and was envious of a knight
who hitherto had answered all his questions. Determined to confound
his humbler rival, he devised three which he thought unanswerable,
sent for the knight, and gave him a fortnight to consider his replies,
which failing, he would lose his goods and head. The knight can make
nothing of these questions, which are, What is that which needs help
least and gets most? What is worth most and costs least? What costs
most and is worth least? The girl, who is but fourteen years old,
observing her father's heavy cheer, asks him the reason, and obtains
his permission to go to court with him and answer the questions. He was
to say to the king that he had deputed her to answer, to make trial of
her wits. The answer to the first question is the earth, and agrees in
the details with the solution of the query, What is fatter than fat?
in the Tyrolese and the Hanoverian tale. Humility is the answer to the
second, and pride the third answer. The king admires the young maid,
and says he would marry her if her father were noble; but she may ask
a boon. She begs for her father an earldom which had lately escheated;
and, this granted, she reminds the king of what he had said; her father
is now noble. The king marries her.</p>

<p>In all these seven tales a daughter gets her father out of trouble
by the exercise of a superior understanding, and marries an emperor,
a king, or at least far above her station. The Grimms' story has the
feature, not found in the others, that the father had been thrown
into prison. Still another variety of these stories, inferior, but
preserving essential traits, is given by Schleicher, Litauische
Märchen, p. 3, 'Vom schlauen Mädchen.'</p>

<p>A Turkish tale from South Siberia will take us a step further, 'Die
beiden Fürsten,' Radloff, Proben der Volkslitteratur der türkischen
Stämme Süd-Sibiriens, <span class="smcap">I</span>, 197. A prince had a feeble-minded
son, for whom he wished to get a wife. He found a girl gathering
fire-wood with others, and, on asking her questions, had reason to
be pleased with her superior discretion. He sent an ox to the girl's
father, with a message that on the third day he would pay him a visit,
and if by that time he had not made the ox drop a calf and give milk,
he would lose his head. The old man and his wife fell to weeping. The
daughter bade them be of good cheer, killed the ox, and gave it to her
parents to eat. On the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-11" id="Pg_1-11">[Pg 11]</a></span> third day she stationed herself on the road by
which the prince would come, and was gathering herbs. The prince asked
what this was for. The girl said, "Because my father is in the pangs of
child-birth, and I am going to spread these herbs under him." "Why,"
said the prince, "it is not the way, that men should bear children."
"But if a man can't bear children," answered the girl, "how can an ox
have a calf?" The prince was pleased, but said nothing. He went away,
and sent his messenger again with three stones in a bag. He would come
on the third day, and if the stones were not then made into boots, the
old man would lose his head. On the third day the prince came, with
all his grandees. The girl was by the roadside, collecting sand in
a bag. "What are you going to do with that sand?" asked the prince.
"Make thread," said she. "But who ever made thread out of sand?" "And
who ever made boots out of stones?" she rejoined. The prince laughed
in his sleeve, prepared a great wedding, and married the girl to his
son. Soon after, another prince wrote him a letter, saying, "Do not
let us be fighting and killing, but let us guess riddles. If you guess
all mine, I will be your subject; if you fail, I will take all your
having." They were a whole year at the riddles. The other prince "knew
three words more," and threw ours into a deep dungeon. From the depths
of this dungeon he contrived to send a profoundly enigmatic dispatch to
his daughter-in-law, who understood everything, disguised herself as
one of his friends, and proposed to the victor to guess riddles again.
The clever daughter-in-law "knew seven words more" than he, took her
father-in-law out of the dungeon, threw his rival in, and had all the
people and property of the vanquished prince for her own.</p>

<p>This Siberian tale links securely those which precede it with a
remarkable group of stories, covering by representatives still extant,
or which may be shown to have existed, a large part of Asia and of
Europe. This group includes, besides a Wallachian and a Magyar tale
from recent popular tradition, one Sanskrit form; two Tibetan, derived
from Sanskrit; one Mongol, from Tibetan; three Arabic and one Persian,
which also had their source in Sanskrit; two Middle-Greek, derived
from Arabic, one of which is lost; and two old Russian, from lost
Middle-Greek versions.<a name="FNanchor_1_16" id="FNanchor_1_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>The gist of these narratives is that one king propounds tasks to
another; in the earlier ones, with the intent to discover whether his
brother monarch enjoys the aid of such counsellors as will make an
attack on him dangerous; in the later, with a demand that he shall
acquit himself satisfactorily, or suffer a forfeit: and the king is
delivered from a serious strait by the sagacity either of a minister
(whom he had ordered to be put to death, but who was still living in
prison, or at least seclusion) or of the daughter of his minister, who
came to her father's assistance. Which is the prior of these two last
inventions it would not be easy to say. These tasks are always such as
require ingenuity of one kind or another, whether in devising practical
experiments, in contriving subterfuges, in solving riddles, or even in
constructing compliments.<a name="FNanchor_1_17" id="FNanchor_1_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>One of the Tibetan tales, which, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-12" id="Pg_1-12">[Pg 12]</a></span> dating from the beginning
of our era, will very easily be recognized in the Siberian tradition
of this century, is to this effect. King Rabssaldschal had a rich
minister, who desired a suitable wife for his youngest son. A Brahman,
his trusty friend, undertook to find one. In the course of his search,
which extended through many countries, the Brahman saw one day a
company of five hundred maidens, who were making garlands to offer
to Buddha. One of these attracted his notice by her behavior, and
impressed him favorably by replies to questions which he put.<a name="FNanchor_1_18" id="FNanchor_1_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
The Brahman made proposals to her father in behalf of the minister's
son. These were accepted, and the minister went with a great train
to fetch home the bride. On the way back his life was twice saved by
taking her advice, and when she was domiciliated, she so surpassed her
sisters-in-law in housekeeping talents and virtues that everything
was put under her direction. Discord arose between the king of the
country she had left and Rabssaldschal, under whom she was now living.
The former wished to make trial whether the latter had an able and
keen-witted minister or not, and sent him two mares, dam and filly,
exactly alike in appearance, with the demand that he should distinguish
them. Neither king nor counsellor could discern any difference; but
when the minister's daughter heard of their difficulty, she said,
"Nothing is easier. Tie the two together and put grass before them;
the mother will push the best before the foal." This was done; the
king decided accordingly, and the hostile ambassador owned that he
was right. Soon after, the foreign prince sent two snakes, of the
same size and form, and demanded which was male, which female. The
king and his advisers were again in a quandary. The minister resorted
to his daughter-in-law. She said, "Lay them both on cotton-wool: the
female will lie quiet, the male not; for it is of the feminine nature
to love the soft and the comfortable, which the masculine cannot
tolerate." They followed these directions; the king gave his verdict,
the ambassador acquiesced, the minister received splendid presents.
For a final trial the unfriendly king sent a long stick of wood, of
equal thickness, with no knots or marks, and asked which was the under
and which the upper end. No one could say. The minister referred the
question to his daughter. She answered, "Put the stick into water: the
root end will sink a little, the upper end float." The experiment was
tried; the king said to the ambassador, "This is the upper end, this
the root end," to which he assented, and great presents were again
given to the minister. The adverse monarch was convinced that his only
safe course was peace and conciliation, and sent his ambassador back
once more with an offering of precious jewels and of amity for the
future. This termination was highly gratifying to Rabssaldschal, who
said to his minister, How could you see through all these things? The
minister said, It was not I, but my clever daughter-in-law. When the
king learned this, he raised the young woman to the rank of his younger
sister.</p>

<p>The wise daughter is not found in the Sanskrit tale,<a name="FNanchor_1_19" id="FNanchor_1_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> which also
differs from the Buddhist versions in this: that in the Sanskrit the
minister had become an object of displeasure to the king, and in
consequence had long been lying in prison when the crisis occurred
which rendered him indispensable, a circumstance which is repeated
in the tale of The Wise Heykar (Arabian Nights, Breslau transl.,
<span class="smcap">XIII</span>, 73 ff, Cabinet des Fées, <span class="smcap">XXXIX</span>, 266 ff) and in
the Life of Æsop. But The Clever Wench reappears in another tale in
the same Sanskrit collection (with that express title), and gives her
aid to her father, a priest, who has been threatened with banishment
by his king if he does not clear up a dark matter within five days.
She may also be recognized in Moradbak, in Von der Hagen's 1001 Tag,
<span class="smcap">VIII</span>, 199 ff, and even in the minister's wife in the story of
The Wise Heykar. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-13" id="Pg_1-13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>The tasks of discriminating dam and filly and the root end from the
tip end of a stick, which occur both in the Tibetan tales and the
Shukasaptati, are found again, with unimportant changes, in the
Wallachian popular story, and the Hungarian, which in general resemble
the Arabic. Some of those in the Arabian tale and in the Life of Æsop
are of the same nature as the wit-trials in the Servian and German
popular tales, the story in the Gesta Romanorum, and the German and
English ballads. The wise Heykar, e.g., is required to sew together a
burst mill-stone. He hands the king a pebble, requesting him first to
make an awl, a file, and scissors out of that. The king of Egypt tells
Æsop, the king of Babylon's champion sage, that when his mares hear the
stallions neigh in Babylon, they cast their foal. Æsop's slaves are
told to catch a cat, and are set to scourging it before the Egyptian
public. Great offense is given, on account of the sacred character of
the animal, and complaint is made to the king, who sends for Æsop in
a rage. Æsop says his king has suffered an injury from this cat, for
the night before the cat had killed a fine fighting-cock of his. "Fie,
Æsop!" says the king of Egypt; "how could the cat go from Egypt to
Babylon in one night?" "Why not," replies Æsop, "as well as mares in
Egypt hear the stallions neigh in Babylon and cast their foal?"</p>

<p>The tales in the Shukasaptati and in the Dsanglun represent the object
of the sending of the tasks to be to ascertain whether the king retains
the capable minister through whom he has acquired supremacy. According
to the Arabian tale, and those derived from it, tribute is to be
paid by the king whose riddles are guessed, or by him who fails to
guess. This form of story, though it is a secondary one, is yet by no
means late, as is shown by the anecdote in Plutarch, Septem Sapientum
Convivium (6), itself probably a fragment of such a story, in which the
king of the Æthiops gives a task to Amasis, king of Egypt, with a stake
of many towns and cities. This task is the favorite one of draining
[drinking] all the water in the sea, which we have had in the Servian
tale (it also is in the Life of Æsop), and Bias gives the customary
advice for dealing with it.<a name="FNanchor_1_20" id="FNanchor_1_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>From the number of these wise virgins should not be excluded the king's
daughter in the Gesta Romanorum who guesses rightly among the riddles
of the three caskets and marries the emperor's son, though Bassanio has
extinguished her just fame: Madden's Old English Versions, p. 238, No
66; Collier, Shakspere's Library, <span class="smcap">II</span>, 102.</p>

<p>The first three or four stanzas of <b>A-E</b> form the beginning of
'<a href="#Ballad_4">Lady Isabel and the Elf-Knight</a>,' and are especially appropriate
to that ballad, but not to this. The two last stanzas of <b>A</b>,
<b>B</b>, make no kind of sense here, and these at least, probably the
opening verses as well, must belong to some other and lost ballad.
An elf setting tasks, or even giving riddles, is unknown, I believe,
in Northern tradition, and in no form of this story, except the
English, is a preternatural personage of any kind the hero. Still it
is better to urge nothing more than that the elf is an intruder in
this particular ballad, for riddle-craft is practised by a variety of
preternatural beings: notoriously by Odin, Thor, the giant Vafþrúðnir,
and the dwarf Alwíss in the Edda, and again by a German "berggeist"
(Ey, Harzmärchenbuch, p. 64, 'Die verwünschte Prinzessin'), a Greek<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-14" id="Pg_1-14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
dragon (Hahn, Griechisebe u. Albanesische Märchen, <span class="smcap">II</span>, 210),
the Russian rusalka, the Servian vila,<a name="FNanchor_1_21" id="FNanchor_1_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> the Indian rakshas. For
example: a rusalka (water-nymph) pursues a pretty girl, and says, I
will give you three riddles: if you guess them, I will let you go home
to your father; if you do not, I shall take you with me. What grows
without a root? What runs without any object? What blooms without
any flower? She answers, Stones grow without a root; water runs
without any object; the fern blooms without any flower. These answers
seem satisfactory, as riddles go, but the ballad concludes (with an
injustice due to corruption?), "The girl did not guess the riddles:
the rusalka tickled her to death." (Wojcicki, Pie&#347;ni, <span class="smcap">I</span>,
205.) A rakshas (ogre) says he will spare a man's life if he can answer
four questions, and shall devour him if he cannot. What is cruel?
What is most to the advantage of a householder? What is love? What
best accomplishes difficult things? These questions the man answers,
and confirms his answers by tales, and gains the rakshas' good will.
(Jacob, Hindoo Tales, or the Adventures of Ten Princes, a translation
of the Sanskrit Dasakumaracharitam, p. 260 ff.)</p>

<p>The auld man in <b>J</b> is simply the "unco knicht" of <b>1 C</b>,
<b>D</b>, over again. He has clearly displaced the elf-knight, for
the elf's attributes of hill-haunting and magical music remain, only
they have been transferred to the lady. That the devil should supplant
the knight, unco or familiar, is natural enough. He may come in as
the substitute of the elfin knight because the devil is the regular
successor to any heathen sprite, or as the embodiment of craft and
duplicity, and to give us the pleasure of seeing him outwitted. We find
the devil giving riddles, as they are called (tasks), in the Grimms'
K. u. H. märchen, No 125 (see also the note in vol. <span class="smcap">III</span>);
Pröhle's K. u. V. märchen, No 19; Vernaleken, Oesterreichische K.
u. H. märchen, No 37. He also appears as a riddle-monger in one of
the best stories in the Golden Legend. A bishop, who was especially
devoted to St Andrew, was tempted by Satan under the semblance of a
beautiful woman, and was all but lost, when a loud knocking was heard
at the door. A pilgrim demanded admittance. The lady, being asked her
pleasure about this, recommended that three questions should be put to
the stranger, to show whether he were fit to appear in such presence.
Two questions having been answered unexceptionably, the fiend proposed
a third, which was meant to be a clincher: How far is it from earth to
heaven? "Go back to him that sent you," said the pilgrim (none other
than St Andrew) to the messenger, "and say that he himself knows best,
for he measured the distance when he fell." <i>Antiquus hostis de medio
evanuit.</i> Much the same is related in the legend of St Bartholomew,
and, in a Slovenian ballad, of St Ulrich, who interposes to save the
Pope from espousing Satan in disguise.<a name="FNanchor_1_22" id="FNanchor_1_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_13" id="Footnote_1_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> All that was required of the burden, Mr Chappell kindly
writes me, was to support the voice by harmonious notes under the
melody; it was not sung <i>after</i> each half of the stanza, or after the
stanza, and it was heard separately only when the voices singing the
air stopped. Even the Danish ballads exhibit but a few cases of these
"burden-stems," as Grundwig calls them: see Danmarks Gamle Folkeviser,
<span class="smcap">II</span>, 221, B 1; 295, B 1; 393, A 1: <span class="smcap">III</span>, 197, D; 470,
A. Such burden-stems are, however, very common in Icelandic ballads.
They are, for the most part, of a different metre from the ballad, and
very often not of the same number of lines as the ballad stanza. A
<i>part</i> of the burden stem would seem to be taken for the refrain; as
Íslenzk Fornkvæði, <span class="smcap">I</span>, 30, of four verses, 1, 2, 4; 129, of
two, the last half of the first and all the second; 194, of four, the
last; 225, of five, the last two; <span class="smcap">II</span>, 52, of five, the second
and last two.
</p>
<p>
In later times the Danish stev-stamme was made to conform to the metre
of the ballad, and sung as the first stanza, the last line perhaps
forming the burden. Compare the stev-stamme, Grundwig, <span class="smcap">III</span>,
470, with the first stanza of the ballad at p. 475. If not so changed,
says Grundtvig, it dropped away. Lyngbye, at the end of his Færöiske
Qvæder, gives the music of a ballad which he had heard sung. The whole
stem is sung first, and then repeated as a burden at the end of every
verse. The modern way, judging by Berggreen, Folke-Sange og Melodier,
3d ed., <span class="smcap">I</span>, 352, 358, is simply to sing the whole stem after
each verse, and so says Grundtvig, <span class="smcap">III</span>, 200, D. The whole stem
is appended to the last stanza (where, as usual, the burden, which had
been omitted after stanza 1, is again expressed) in the Færöe ballad
in Grundtvig, <span class="smcap">III</span>, 199, exactly as in our broadside, or in
Motherwell's Minstrelsy, Appendix, p. iii. I must avow myself to be
very much in the dark as to the exact relation of stem and burden.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_14" id="Footnote_1_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> Grundtvig has noticed the resemblance of G.R. 64 and
the ballad.&mdash;Much of what follows is derived from the admirable

are apt to think of as peculiarly mediæval: What is oldest? What is
most beautiful, biggest, wisest, strongest? etc. Two of these we have
had in Zingerle's story. They are answered in a commonplace way by the
Æthiop, with more refinement by Thales. Seven similar questions were
propounded by David to his sons, to determine who was worthiest to
succeed him, and answered by Solomon, according to an Arabian writer
of the 14th century: Rosenöl, <span class="smcap">I</span>, 167. Amasis also sent a
victim to Bias (2), and asked him to cut out the best and worst of the
flesh. Bias cut out the tongue. Here the two anticipate the Anglo-Saxon
Salomon and Saturn: "Tell me what is best and worst among men." "I
tell thee word is best and worst:" Kemble, p. 188, No 37; Adrian and

THE FAUSE KNIGHT UPON THE ROAD</h2>

<div class="blockquot">

Minstrelsy, Introduction, p. lxxiv.</p>

<p><b><a href="#Version_3_B">B</a>.</b> 'The False Knight,' Motherwell's Minstrelsy,
Appendix, Musick, p. xxiv.</p></div>


<p>This singular ballad is known only through Motherwell. The opening
stanza of a second version is given by the editor of the music, Mr.
Blaikie, in the Appendix to the Minstrelsy. The idea at the bottom
of the piece is that the devil will carry off the wee boy if he can
nonplus him. So, in certain humorous stories, a fool wins a princess by
dumfounding her: e.g., Halliwell's Popular Rhymes and Nursery-Tales, p.
32; Von der Hagen's Gesammtabenteuer, No 63, iii, 179; Asbjørnsen og
Moe, Norske Folkeeventyr, No 4. But here the boy always gets the last
word. (See further on, under '<a href="#Ballad_46">Captain Wedderburn's Courtship.</a>')</p>

<p>An extremely curious Swedish ballad of the same description, from the
Lappfiord, Finland, with the substitution of an old crone, possibly
a witch, and clearly no better than one of the wicked, for the false
knight, is given by Oskar Rancken in Några Prof af Folksång och Saga i
det svenska Österbotten, p. 25, No 10. It is a point in both that the
replicant is a wee boy (gossen, som liten var).</p>

<p>Chambers, in his Popular Rhymes of Scotland, p. 66 of the new edition,
gives, without a word of explanation, a piece, 'Harpkin,' which
seems to have been of the same character, but now sounds only like a
"flyting."<a name="FNanchor_1_23" id="FNanchor_1_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> The first stanza would lead us to expect that Harpkin
is to be a form of the Elfin Knight of the preceding ballad, but Fin
is seen to be the uncanny one of the two by the light of the other
ballads. Finn (Fin) is an ancestor of Woden, a dwarf in Völuspá 16
(19), and also a trold (otherwise a giant), who is induced by a saint
to build a church: Thiele, Danske Folkesagn, <span class="smcap">I</span>, 45, Grimm,
Mythologie, p. 455. The name is therefore diabolic by many antecedents.</p>

<p>Of all ballads this has perhaps obtained the widest circulation. It
is nearly as well known to the southern as to the northern nations of
Europe. It has an extraordinary currency in Poland. The Germans, Low
and High, and the Scandinavians, preserve it, in a full and evidently
ancient form, even in the tradition of this generation. Among the Latin
nations it has, indeed, shrunk to very meagre proportions, and though
the best English forms are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-23" id="Pg_1-23">[Pg 23]</a></span> without ancient and distinctive marks,
most of these have been eliminated, and the better ballads are very
brief.</p>

<p><b>A</b> has but thirteen two-line stanzas. An elf-knight, by blowing
his horn, inspires Lady Isabel with love-longing. He appears on her
first breathing a wish for him, and induces her to ride with him to the
greenwood.<a name="FNanchor_1_24" id="FNanchor_1_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Arrived at the wood, he bids her alight, for she is come
to the place where she is to die. He had slain seven kings' daughters
there, and she should be the eighth. She persuades him to sit down,
with his head on her knee, lulls him asleep with a charm, binds him
with his own sword-belt, and stabs him with his own dagger, saying, If
seven kings' daughters you have slain, lie here a husband to them all.</p>

<p><b>B</b>, in fourteen four-line stanzas, begins unintelligibly with a
bird coming out of a bush for water, and a king's daughter sighing,
"Wae 's this heart o mine." A personage not characterized, but
evidently of the same nature as the elf-knight in <b>A</b>, lulls
everybody but this king's daughter asleep with his harp,<a name="FNanchor_1_25" id="FNanchor_1_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> then
mounts her behind him, and rides to a piece of water called Wearie's
Well. He makes her wade in up to her chin; then tells her that he has
drowned seven kings' daughters here, and she is to be the eighth. She
asks him for one kiss before she dies, and, as he bends over to give
it, pitches him from his saddle into the water, with the words, Since
ye have drowned seven here, I'll make you bridegroom to them all.<a name="FNanchor_1_26" id="FNanchor_1_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p><b>C</b> was first published by David Herd, in the second edition of

with a copy obtained from recitation. <b>D</b>,<a name="FNanchor_1_27" id="FNanchor_1_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>
are all broadside or stall copies, and in broadside style. <b>C</b>,
<b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b> have nearly the same story. False Sir
John, a knight from the south country [west country, north lands],
entices May Colven, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b> [a king's daughter, <b>C</b> 16,
<b>E</b> 16; a knight's daughter, Polly, <b>F</b> 4, 9], to ride off
with him, employing, in <b>D</b>, a charm which he has stuck in her
sleeve. At the knight's suggestion, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, she takes a
good sum of money with her, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>. They come to
a lonely rocky place by the sea [river-side, <b>F</b>], and the knight
bids her alight: he has drowned seven ladies here [eight <b>D</b>, six
<b>E</b>, <b>F</b>], and she shall be the next. But first she is to
strip off her rich clothes, as being too good to rot in the sea. She
begs him to avert his eyes, for decency's sake, and, getting behind
him, throws him into the water. In <b>F</b> he is absurdly sent for a
sickle, to crop the nettles on the river brim, and is pushed in while
thus occupied.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-24" id="Pg_1-24">[Pg 24]</a></span> He cries for help, and makes fair promises, <b>C</b>,
<b>E</b>, but the maid rides away, with a bitter jest [on his steed,
<b>D</b>, leading his steed, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>], and reaches her
father's house before daybreak. The groom inquires in <b>D</b> about
the strange horse, and is told that it is a found one. The parrot asks
what she has been doing, and is silenced with a bribe; and when the
father demands why he was chatting so early, says he was calling to his
mistress to take away the cat. Here <b>C</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b> stop,
but <b>D</b> goes on to relate that the maid at once tells her parents
what has happened, and that the father rides off at dawn, under her
conduct, to find Sir John. They carry off the corpse, which lay on the
sands below the rocks, and bury it, for fear of discovery.</p>

<p>There is in Hone's Table Book, <span class="smcap">III</span>, 130, ed. 1841, a
<i>rifacimento</i> by Dixon of the common English broadside in what passes
for old-ballad style. This has been repeated in Richardson's Borderer's
Table Book, <span class="smcap">VI</span>, 367; in Dixon's Scottish Traditional Versions
of Ancient Ballads, p. 101; and, with alterations, additions, and
omissions, in Sheldon's Minstrelsy of the English Border, p. 194.</p>

<p>Jamieson (1814) had never met with this ballad in Scotland, at least
in anything like a perfect state; but he says that a tale to the same
effect, intermixed with scraps of verse, was familiar to him when a
boy, and that he afterwards found it, "in much the same state, in the
Highlands, in Lochaber and Ardnamurchan." According to the tradition
reported by Jamieson, the murderer had seduced the younger sister
of his wife, and was seeking to prevent discovery, a difference in
the story which might lead us to doubt the accuracy of Jamieson's
recollection. (Illustrations of Northern Antiquities, p. 348.)</p>

<p>Stories like that of this ballad will inevitably be attached, and
perhaps more or less adapted, to localities where they become known.
May Collean, says Chambers, Scottish Ballads, p. 232, note, "finds
locality in that wild portion of the coast of Carrick (Ayrshire)
which intervenes betwixt Girvan and Ballantrae. Carlton Castle, about
two miles to the south of Girvan (a tall old ruin, situated on the
brink of a bank which overhangs the sea, and which gives title to Sir
John Cathcart, Bart, of Carlton), is affirmed by the country people,
who still remember the story with great freshness, to have been the
residence of 'the fause Sir John;' while a tall rocky eminence called
Gamesloup, overhanging the sea about two miles still further south,
and over which the road passes in a style terrible to all travellers,
is pointed out as the place where he was in the habit of drowning his
wives, and where he was finally drowned himself. The people, who look
upon the ballad as a regular and proper record of an unquestionable
fact, farther affirm that May Collean was a daughter of the family
of Kennedy of Colzean," etc. Binyan's (Bunion) Bay, in <b>D</b>, is,
according to Buchan, the old name of the mouth of the river Ugie.</p>

<p>Far better preserved than the English, and marked with very ancient
and impressive traits, is the Dutch ballad 'Halewijn,' which, not
many years ago, was extensively sung in Brabant and Flanders, and is
still popular as a broadside, both oral tradition and printed copies
exhibiting manifold variations. A version of this ballad (<b>A</b>)
was communicated by Willems to Mone's Anzeiger in 1836, col. 448 ff,
thirty-eight two-line stanzas, and afterwards appeared in Willems's
Oude vlaemsche Liederen (1848), No 49, p. 116, with some changes in the
text and some various readings. Uhland, <span class="smcap">I</span>, 153, 74 D, gave
the Anzeiger text, with one correction. So Hoffmann, Niederländische
Volkslieder, 2d ed., No 9, p. 39, but substituting for stanzas 19,
20 four stanzas from the margin of O.v.L., and making other slighter
changes. Baecker, Chants historiques de la Flandre, No 9, p. 61,
repeats Willems's second text, with one careless omission and one
transposition. Coussemaker, Chants populaires des Flamands de France,
No 45, p. 142, professes to give the text of Oude vlaemsche Liederen,
and does so nearly. Snellaert, Oude en nieuwe Liedjes, 3d ed., 1864, No
55, p. 58, inserts seven stanzas in the place of 33, 34 of O.v.L., and
two after 35, making forty-five two- (or three-) line stanzas instead
of thirty-eight. These additions are also found in an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-25" id="Pg_1-25">[Pg 25]</a></span> excessively
corrupt form of the ballad (<b>B</b>), Hoffmann, No 10, p. 43, in which
the stanzas have been uniformly extended to three verses, to suit the
air, which required the repetition of the second line of the original
stanza.</p>

<p>Heer Halewijn (<b>A</b>), like the English elf-knight, sang such a song
that those who heard it longed to be with him. A king's daughter asked
her father if she might go to Halewijn. No, he said; those who go that
way never come back [sixteen have lost their lives, <b>B</b>]. So said
mother and sister, but her brother's answer was, I care not where you
go, so long as you keep your honor. She dressed herself splendidly,
took the best horse from her father's stable, and rode to the wood,
where she found Halewijn waiting for her.<a name="FNanchor_1_28" id="FNanchor_1_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> They then rode on
further, till they came to a gallows, on which many women were hanging.
Halewijn says, Since you are the fairest maid, choose your death
[<b>B</b> 20 offers the choice between hanging and the sword]. She
calmly chooses the sword. "Only take off your coat first, for a maid's
blood spirts a great way, and it would be a pity to spatter you." His
head was off before his coat, but the tongue still spake. This dialogue
ensues:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Go yonder into the corn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And blow upon my horn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That all my friends you may warn.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Into the corn I will not go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on your horn I will not blow:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A murderer's bidding I will not do.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Go yonder under the gallows-tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fetch a pot of salve for me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rub my red neck lustily.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Under the gallows I will not go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor will I rub your red neck, no,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A murderer's bidding I will not do.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She takes the head by the hair and washes it in a spring, and rides
back through the wood. Half-way through she meets Halewijn's mother,
who asks after her son; and she tells her that he is gone hunting, that
he will never be seen again, that he is dead, and she has his head in
her lap. When she came to her father's gate, she blew the horn like any
man.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And when the father heard the strain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was glad she had come back again.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thereupon they held a feast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The head was on the table placed.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Snellaert's copy and the modern three-line ballad have a meeting with
father, brother, sister, and mother successively. The maid's answer
to each of the first three is that Halewijn is amusing himself with
sixteen maids, or to that effect, but to the mother that he is dead,
and she has his head in her lap. The mother angrily replies, in
<b>B</b>, that if she had given this information earlier she would
not have got so far on her way home. The maid retorts, Wicked woman,
you are lucky not to have been served as your son; then rides, "like
Judith wise," straight to her father's palace, where she blows the horn
blithely, and is received with honor and love by the whole court.<a name="FNanchor_1_29" id="FNanchor_1_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>Another Flemish version (<b>C</b>) has been lately published under the
title, 'Roland,' by which only, we are informed, is this particular
form known in Bruges and many parts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-26" id="Pg_1-26">[Pg 26]</a></span> Flanders:<a name="FNanchor_1_30" id="FNanchor_1_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Chants populaires
recueillis à Bruges par Adolphe Lootens et J. M. E. Feys, No 37, p. 60,
183 vv, in sixty-three stanzas, of two, three, four, or five lines.
This text dates from the last century, and is given with the most exact
fidelity to tradition. It agrees with <b>A</b> as to some main points,
but differs not a little as to others. The story sets out thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It was a bold Roland,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He loved a lass from England;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He wist not how to get her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With reading or with writing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With brawling or with fighting.<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>Roland has lost Halewyn's art of singing. Louise asks her father if
she may go to Roland, to the fair, as all her friends do. Her father
refuses: Roland is "een stoute kalant," a bad fellow that betrays
pretty maids; he stands with a drawn sword in his hand, and all his
soldiers in armor. The daughter says she has seen Roland more than
once, and that the tale about the drawn sword and soldiers is not
true. This scene is exactly repeated with mother and brother. Louise
then tries her shrift-father. He is easier, and does not care where
she goes, provided she keeps her honor and does not shame her parents.
She tells father, mother, and brother that she has leave from her
confessor, makes her toilet as in <b>A</b>, takes the finest horse
in the stable, and rides to the wood. There she successively meets
Roland's father, mother, and brother, each of whom asks her where she
is going, and whether she has any right to the crown she wears. To all
she replies, Whether I have or not, be off; I know you not. She does
not encounter Roland in the wood, they do not ride together, and there
is no gallows-field. She enters Roland's house, where he is lying abed.
He bids her gather three rose-wreaths "at his hands" and three at his
feet; but when she approaches the foot of the bed he rises, and offers
her the choice to lose her honor or kneel before the sword. She chooses
the sword, advises him to spare his coat, and, while he is taking it
off, strikes off his head, all as in <b>A</b>. The head speaks: Go
under the gallows (of which we have heard nothing hitherto), fetch a
pot of salve, rub it on my wounds, and they shall straight be well.
She declines to follow a murderer's rede, or to learn magic. The head
bids her go under the blue stone and fetch a pot of maidens-grease,
which also will heal the wounds. This again she refuses to do, in the
same terms; then seizes the head by the hair, washes it in a spring,
and rides off with it through the wood, duly meeting Roland's father,
mother, and brother once more, all of whom challenge her, and to all of
whom she answers,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Roland your son is long ago dead;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God has his soul and I his head;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For in my lap here I have his head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with the blood my apron is red.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>When she came back to the city the drums and the trumpets struck
up.<a name="FNanchor_1_31" id="FNanchor_1_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> She stuck the head out of the window, and cried, "Now I am
Roland's bride!" She drew it in, and cried, "Now I am a heroine!"</p>

<p><b>Danish.</b> Eleven versions of this ballad are known in Danish,
seven of which are given in Danmarks gamle Folkeviser, No 183,
'Kvindemorderen,' <b>A-G</b>. Four more, <b>H-L</b>, are furnished by
Kristensen, Jydske Folkeviser, <span class="smcap">I</span>, Nos 46, 47, 91; <span class="smcap">II</span>,
No 85. <b>A</b>, in forty-one two-line stanzas (previously printed
in Grundtvig's Engelske og skotske Folkeviser, p. 233), is from a
16th century MS.; <b>B</b>, thirty stanzas,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-27" id="Pg_1-27">[Pg 27]</a></span> <b>C</b>, twenty-four,
<b>D</b>, thirty-seven, from MSS of the 17th century; <b>E</b>,
fifty-seven, from a broadside of the end of the 18th; <b>F</b>, thirty,
from one of the beginning of the 19th; and <b>G-L</b>, thirty-five,
twenty-three, thirty-one, twenty-six, thirty-eight stanzas, from recent
oral tradition.</p>

<p>The four older versions, and also <b>E</b>, open with some lines that
occur at the beginning of other ballads.<a name="FNanchor_1_32" id="FNanchor_1_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> In <b>A</b> and <b>E</b>,
and, we may add, <b>G</b>, the maid is allured by the promise of being
taken to a paradise exempt from death and sorrow; <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>,
<b>F</b> promise a train of handmaids and splendid presents. All the
versions agree very well as to the kernel of the story. A false knight
prevails upon a lady to elope with him, and they ride to a wood [they
simply meet in a wood, <b>H</b>, <b>K</b>]. He sets to work digging
a grave, which she says is too long for his [her] dog and too narrow
for his [her] horse [all but <b>F</b>, <b>H</b>]. She is told that the
grave is for her. He has taken away the life [and honor, <b>B</b>,
<b>C</b>, <b>I</b>] of eight maids, and she shall be the ninth. The
eight maids become nine kings' daughters in <b>E</b>, ten in <b>F</b>,
nineteen in <b>G</b>, and in <b>E</b> and <b>F</b> the hard choice is
offered of death by sword, tree, or stream. In <b>A</b>, <b>E</b>,
<b>I</b>, <b>L</b> the knight bids the lady get her gold together
before she sets out with him, and in <b>D</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>K</b>,
<b>L</b> he points out a little knoll under which he keeps the gold of
his previous victims. The maid now induces the knight to lie down with
his head in her lap, professing a fond desire to render him the most
homely of services<a name="FNanchor_1_33" id="FNanchor_1_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> [not in <b>C</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>K</b>].
He makes an express condition in <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>,
<b>H</b>, <b>L</b> that she shall not betray him in his sleep, and she
calls Heaven to witness that she will not. In <b>G</b> she sings him
to sleep. He slept a sleep that was not sweet. She binds him hand and
foot, then cries, Wake up! I will not betray you in sleep.<a name="FNanchor_1_34" id="FNanchor_1_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Eight
you have killed; yourself shall be the ninth. Entreaties and fair
promises and pretences that he had been in jest, and desire for shrift,
are in vain. Woman-fashion she drew his sword, but man-fashion she cut
him down. She went home a maid.</p>

<p><b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>, however, do not end so simply. On her way
home through the wood [<b>E</b>], she comes upon a maid who is working
gold, and who says, The last time I saw that horse my brother rode it.
She answers, Your brother is dead, and will do no more murdering for
gold; then turns her horse, and sets the sister's bower on fire. Next
she encounters seven robbers on the heath, who recognize the horse as
their master's, and are informed of his death and of the end of his
crimes. They ask about the fire. She says it is an old pig-sty. She
rides on, and they call to her that she is losing her horse's gold
shoe. But nothing can stop her; she bids them pick it up and drink it
in wine; and so comes home to her father's. <b>F</b> has nothing of
the sister; in place of seven robbers there are nine of the robber's
brothers, and the maid sets their house on fire. <b>G</b> indulges in
absurd extravagances: the heroine meets the robber's sister with twelve
fierce dogs, and then his twelve swains, and cuts down both dogs and
swains.</p>

<p>The names in the Danish ballads are, <b>A</b>, Ulver and Vænelil;
<b>B</b>, Olmor, or Oldemor, and Vindelraad; <b>C</b>, Hollemen and
Vendelraad; <b>D</b>, Romor, Reimord, or Reimvord, and the maid
unnamed; <b>F</b>, Herr Peder and Liden Kirsten; <b>H-L</b>, Ribold,
Rigbold [<b>I</b>, Rimmelil] and Guldborg.</p>

<p>Four <b>Swedish</b> versions are known, all from tradition of this
century. <b>A</b>, 'Den Falske Riddaren,' twenty-three two-line
stanzas, Arwidsson, 44 B, <span class="smcap">I</span>, 301. <b>B</b>, 'Röfvaren
Brun,' fifteen stanzas, Afzelius, 83, <span class="smcap">III</span>, 97. <b>C</b>,
twen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-28" id="Pg_1-28">[Pg 28]</a></span>ty-seven stanzas, Arwidsson, 44 A, <span class="smcap">I</span>, 298. <b>D</b>,
'Röfvaren Rymer,' sixteen stanzas, Afzelius, 82, <span class="smcap">III</span>, 94.
<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>D</b> have resemblances, at the beginning, to
the Ribold ballads, like the Danish <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>E</b>,
<b>G</b>, while the beginning of <b>C</b> is like the Danish <b>C</b>,
<b>D</b>, <b>F</b>. <b>A</b> has the grave-digging; there have been
eight maids before; the knight lays his head in the lady's lap for
the same reason as in most of the Danish ballads, and under the same
assurance that he shall not be betrayed in sleep; he is bound, and
conscientiously waked before his head is struck off; and the lady
rides home to her father's. There have been eight previous victims
in <b>C</b>, and they king's daughters; in <b>B</b>, eleven (maids);
<b>D</b> says not how many, but, according to an explanation of the
woman that sang it, there were seven princesses. <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>,
like Danish <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>, make the maid encounter
some of the robber's family on the way home. By a misconception, as
we perceive by the Dutch ballad, she is represented as blowing the
robber's horn. Seven sisters come at the familiar sound to bury the
murdered girl and share the booty, but find that they have their
brother to bury.</p>

<p>The woman has no name in any of the Swedish ballads. <b>A</b> calls the
robber "an outlandish man" (en man ifrån fremmande land), <b>B</b>,
simple Brun, <b>C</b>, a knight, and <b>D</b>, Riddaren Rymer, or Herr
Rymer.</p>

<p>Of <b>Norwegian</b> versions, but two have been printed: <b>A</b>,
'Svein Norðmann,' twenty two-line stanzas, Landstad, 69, p. 567;
<b>B</b>, 'Rullemann og Hildeborg,' thirty stanzas, Landstad, 70, p.
571, both from recent recitation. Bugge has communicated eight others
to Grundtvig. Both <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> have the paradise at the
beginning, which is found in Danish <b>A</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>G</b>, and
Swedish <b>D</b>. In both the lady gets her gold together while the
swain is saddling his horse. They come to a grave already dug, which in
<b>B</b> is said to be made so very wide because Rulleman has already
laid nine maidens in it. The stanza in <b>A</b> which should give the
number is lost, but the reciter or singer put it at seven or nine.
The maid gets the robber into her power by the usual artifice, with a
slight variation in <b>B</b>. According to <b>A</b>, she rides straight
home to her father. <b>B</b>, like Danish <b>F</b>, has an encounter
with her false lover's [five] brothers. They ask, Where is Rullemann,
thy truelove? She answers, He is lying down, in the green mead, and
bloody is his bridal bed.</p>

<p>Of the unprinted versions obtained by Professor Bugge, two indicate
that the murderer's sleep was induced by a spell, as in English
<b>A</b>. <b>F</b> 9 has,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Long time stood Gullbjör; to herself she thought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May none of my <i>runes</i> avail me ought?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And <b>H</b> 18, as also a variant to <b>B</b> 20, says it was a
rune-slumber that came over him. Only <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>I</b>,
<b>K</b> give the number of the murdered women: in <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>,
eight, in <b>I</b>, nine, in <b>K</b>, five.</p>

<p>The names are, in <b>A</b>, Svein Norðmann and Guðbjörg; <b>B</b>,
Rulleman and Hildeborg [or Signe]; <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>,
<b>F</b>, Svein Nórmann and Gullbjör [Gunnbjör]; <b>G</b>, Rullemann
and Kjersti; <b>H</b>, Rullball and Signelill; <b>I</b>, Alemarken and
Valerós; <b>K</b>, Rulemann and a fair maid.</p>

<p>Such information as has transpired concerning <b>Icelandic</b> versions
of this ballad is furnished by Grundtvig, <span class="smcap">IV</span>, 4. The Icelandic
form, though curtailed and much injured, has shown tenacity enough to
preserve itself in a series of closely agreeing copies from the 17th
century down. The eldest, from a manuscript of 1665, runs thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">'Thou art now the eleventh, I'll not let thee slip.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A copy, from the beginning of the 18th century, has, in stanza 2, "Ása
went into the <i>wood</i>," a recent copy, "over the fields;" and stanza 3,
in the former, with but slight differences in all the modern copies,
reads,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Welcome art thou, Ása maid! thou wilt mean to loose me.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Some recent copies (there is one in Berggreen, Danske Folkesange, 2d
ed., <span class="smcap">I</span>, 162) allow the maid to escape, adding,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>This is certainly one of the most important of the <b>German</b>

known versions. Excepting two broadsides of about 1560, and two copies

<p>The German ballads, as Grundtvig has pointed out, divide into three
well-marked classes. The first class, embracing the versions <b>A-F</b>
(6), and coming nearest to English and Dutch tradition, has been found
along the lower half of the Rhine and in Westphalia, or in Northwest
Germany; the second, including <b>G-S</b> (13), is met with in Swabia,
Switzerland, Bohemia, Moravia, Styria, Carniola, or in South Germany;
the third, <b>T-Z</b> (7), in East Prussia, the eastern part of
Brandenburg and of Saxony, Silesia, and, again, Moravia, or, roughly
speaking, in North and East Germany; but, besides the Moravian, there
is also of this third class one version, in two copies, from the Rhine.</p>

<p>(I.) <b>A</b> runs thus. She that would ride out with Gert Olbert
must dress in silk and gold. When fair Helena had so attired herself,
she called from her window, Gert Olbert, come and fetch the bride.
He took her by her silken gown and swung her on behind him, and they
rode three days and nights. Helena then said, We must eat and drink;
but Gert Olbert said, We must go on further. They rode over the green
heath, and Helena once more tenderly asked for refreshment. Under yon
fir [linden], said Gert Olbert, and kept on till they came to a green
spot, where nine maids were hanging. Then it was, Wilt thou choose
the fir-tree, the running stream, or the naked sword? She chose the
sword, but begged him to take off his silken coat, "for a maid's blood
spirts far, and I should be sorry to spatter it." While he was engaged
in drawing off his coat, she cut off his head. But still the false
tongue spoke. It bade her blow in his horn; then she would have company
enough. She was not so simple as to do this. She rode three days and
nights, and blew the horn when she reached her father's castle. Then
all the murderers came running, like hounds after a hare. Frau Clara
[Jutte] called out, Where is my son? Under the fir-tree, sporting with
nine maids; he meant me to be the tenth, said Helena.</p>

<p><b>B</b> is the same story told of a margrave and Fair Annie, but some
important early stanzas are lost, and the final ones have suffered
injury; for the ballad ends with this conceit, "She put the horn to
her mouth, and blew the margrave quite out of her heart." Here, by a
transference exceedingly common in tradition, it is the man, and not
the maid, that "would ride in velvet and silk and red gold."</p>

<p><b>C a</b> has the names Odilia and Hilsinger, a trooper (reiter).
Odilia was early left an orphan, and as she grew up "she grew into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-31" id="Pg_1-31">[Pg 31]</a></span> the
trooper's bosom." He offered her seven pounds of gold to be his, and
"she thought seven pounds of gold a good thing." We now fall into the
track of <b>A</b>. Odilia dresses herself like a bride, and calls to
the trooper to come and get her. They ride first to a high hill, where
she asks to eat and drink, and then go on to a linden-tree, on which
seven maids are hanging. The choice of three deaths is offered, the
sword chosen, he is entreated to spare his coat, she seizes his sword
and hews off his head. The false tongue suggests blowing the horn.
Odilia thinks "much biding or blowing is not good." She rides away, and
presently meets the trooper's "little foot-page" (bot), who fancies she
has Hilsinger's horse and sword. "He sleeps," she says, "with seven
maids, and thought I was to be the eighth." This copy concludes with a
manifestly spurious stanza. <b>C b</b> agrees with <b>C a</b> for ten
stanzas, as to the matter, and so far seems to be <b>C a</b> improved
by Zuccalmaglio, with such substitutions as a princely castle for
"seven pounds of gold." The last stanza (11),</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Und als die Sternlein am Himmel klar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ottilia die achte der Todten war,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>was, no doubt, suggested by the last of <b>F</b>, another of
Zuccalmaglio's versions, and, if genuine, would belong to a ballad of
the third class.</p>

<p><b>D</b> has the name Odilia for the maid, but the knight, or trooper,
has become expressly a robber (ritter, reiter, räuber). They ride to
a green heath, where there is a cool spring. Odilia asks for and gets
a draught of water, and is told that at the linden-tree there will be
eating and drinking for them. And when they come to the linden, there
hang six, seven maids! All proceeds as before. The talking head is
lost. Odilia meets the robber's mother, and makes the usual reply.<a name="FNanchor_1_37" id="FNanchor_1_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p><b>E</b> resembles <b>C</b> closely. Odilia becomes Schondilg (Schön
Odilie), Räuber returns to Ritter, or Reiter, and the servant-maid
bribe of seven pounds of gold rises to ten tons.<a name="FNanchor_1_38" id="FNanchor_1_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Schondilg's
toilet, preparatory to going off (6-8), is described with a minuteness
that we find only in the Dutch ballad (12-16). After this, there is no
important variation. She meets the trooper's three brothers, and makes
the same replies to them as to the mother in <b>D</b>.</p>

<p><b>F.</b> The personages here are Linnich (i.e., Nellie) and a knight
from England. The first twelve stanzas do not diverge from <b>C</b>,
<b>D</b>, <b>E</b>. In stanza 13 we find the knight directing the
lady to strip off her silk gown and gold necklace, as in the English
<b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>; but certainly this inversion of the
procedure which obtains in German <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b> is an
accident arising from confused recollection. The 14th and last stanza
similarly misunderstands the maid's feigned anxiety about the knight's
fine coat, and brings the ballad to a false close, resembling the
termination of those of the third class, still more those of certain
mixed forms to be spoken of presently.</p>

<p>(II.) The second series, <b>G-S</b>, has three or four traits that
are not found in the foregoing ballads. <b>G</b>, which, as well as
<b>H</b>, was in print more than two hundred years before any other
copy is known to have been taken down, begins, like the Dutch Halewijn,
with a knight (Ulinger) singing so sweetly that a maid (Fridburg) is
filled with desire to go off with him. He promises to teach her his
art. This magical song is wanting only in <b>R</b>, of class II, and
the promise to teach it only in <b>Q</b>, <b>R</b>. She attires herself
splendidly; he swings her on to his horse behind him, and they ride to
a wood. When they came to the wood there was no one there but a white
dove on a hazel-bush, that sang, Listen, Fridburg: Ulinger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-32" id="Pg_1-32">[Pg 32]</a></span> has hanged
eleven<a name="FNanchor_1_39" id="FNanchor_1_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> maids; the twelfth is in his clutches. Fridburg asked what
the dove was saying. Ulinger replied, It takes me for another; it lies
in its red bill; and rode on till it suited him to alight. He spread
his cloak on the grass, and asked her to sit down:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Er sprach sie solt ihm lausen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sein gelbes Haar zerzausen.<a name="FNanchor_1_40" id="FNanchor_1_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Looking up into her eyes, he saw tears, and asked why she was weeping.
Was it for her sorry husband? Not for her sorry husband, she said.
But here some stanzas, which belong to another ballad,<a name="FNanchor_1_41" id="FNanchor_1_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> have crept
in, and she is, with no reason, made to ride further on. She comes
to a lofty fir, and eleven maids hanging on it. She wrings her hands
and tears her hair, and implores Ulinger to let her be hanged in her
clothes as she is.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Ask me not that, Fridburg,' he said;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Thy scarlet mantle and kirtle black<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will well become my young sister's back.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then she begs to be allowed three cries.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'So much I may allow thee well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou art so deep within the dell;<br /></span>

<p>She cries, "Help, Jesu!" "Help, Mary!" "Help, dear brother!"</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'For if thou come not straight,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p><b>H</b>, the nearly contemporaneous Augsburg broadside, differs from
<b>G</b> in only one important particular. The "reuter" is Adelger, the
lady unnamed. A stanza is lost between 6 and 7, which should contain
the warning of the dove, and so is Adelger's version of what the bird
had said. The important feature in <b>H</b>, not present in <b>G</b>,
is that the halt is made near a spring, about which blood is streaming,
"der war mit blut umbrunnenn." This adds a horror to this powerful
scene which well suits with it. When the maid begins to weep, Adelger
asks whether her tears are for her father's land, or because she
dislikes him so much. It is for neither reason, but because on yon fir
she sees eleven maids hanging. He confirms her fears:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Ah, thou fair young lady fine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O palsgravine, O empress mine,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-33" id="Pg_1-33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Adelger 's killed his eleven before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou 'lt be the twelfth, of that be sure.'<a name="FNanchor_1_42" id="FNanchor_1_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The last two lines seem, by their form, to be the dove's warning that
has dropped out between stanzas 6 and 7. The maid's clothes in <b>H</b>
are destined to be the perquisite of Adelger's mother, and the brother
says that Adelger's are to go to his shield-bearer. The unhappy maid
cries but twice, to the Virgin and to her brother. When surprised by
the brother, Adelger feigns to be twisting a withe for his falcon.</p>

<p><b>I</b> begins, like <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>, with the knight's seductive
song. Instead of the dove directly warning the maid, it upbraids the
man: "Whither now, thou Ollegehr?<a name="FNanchor_1_43" id="FNanchor_1_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Eight hast thou murdered already;
and now for the ninth!" The maid asks what the dove means, and is told
to ride on, and not mind the dove, who takes him for another man.
There are eight maids in the fir. The cries are to Jesus, Mary, and
her brothers, one of whom hastens to the rescue. He is struck with the
beauty of his sister's attire,&mdash;her velvet dress, her virginal crown,
"which you shall wear many a year yet." So saying, he draws his sword,
and whips off his "brother-in-law's" head, with this epicedium:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Lie there, thou head, and bleed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou never didst good deed.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Lie there, thou head, and rot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No man shall mourn thy lot.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'No one shall ever be sorry for thee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the small birds on the greenwood tree.'<a name="FNanchor_1_44" id="FNanchor_1_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In <b>J</b>, again, the knight comes riding through the reeds, and
sings such a song that Brown Annele, lying under the casement,
exclaims, "Could I but sing like him, I would give my troth and my
honor!" There are, by mistake, two<a name="FNanchor_1_45" id="FNanchor_1_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> doves in stanza 4, that warn
Annele not to be beguiled, but this error is set right in the next
stanza. When she asks what the dove is cooing, the answer is, "It is
cooing about its red foot; it went barefoot all winter." We have here
again, as in <b>H</b>, the spring in the wood, "mit Blute umrunnen,"
and the lady asks again the meaning of the bloody spring. The knight
replies, in a stanza which seems both corrupted and out of place,
"This is where the eleven pure virgins perished." Then follow the same
incidents as in <b>G-I</b>. He says she must hang with the eleven in
the fir, and be queen over all. Her cries are for her father, for Our
Lady, and for her brother, who is a hunter in the forest. The hunter
makes all haste to his sister, twists a withe, and hangs the knight
without a word between them, then takes his sister by the hand and
conducts her home, with the advice never more to trust a knight: for
all which she returns her devout thanks.<a name="FNanchor_1_46" id="FNanchor_1_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p><b>K</b> and <b>L</b> are of the same length and the same tenor as
<b>J</b>. There are no names in <b>L</b>; in <b>K</b> both Annele and
Ulrich, but the latter is very likely to have been inserted by the
editor. <b>K</b>, <b>L</b> have only one dove, and in neither does the
lady ask the meaning of the dove's song. The knight simply says, "Be
still; thou liest in thy throat!" Both have the bloody spring, but out
of place, for it is very improperly spoken of by the knight as the spot
he is making for:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-34" id="Pg_1-34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Wir wollen ein wenig weiter vorwärts faren,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bis zu einem kühlen Waldbrunnen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Der ist mit Blut überronnen.'<a name="FNanchor_1_47" id="FNanchor_1_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="source">L 26-28, 17-19.</p>

<p>The three cries are for father, mother, brother. In <b>K</b> the
brother fights with "Ulrich" two hours and a half before he can master
him, then despatches him with his two-edged sword, and hangs him in
a withe. He fires his rifle in <b>L</b>, to announce his coming, and
hears his sister's laugh; then stabs the knight through the heart.
The moral of <b>J</b> is repeated in both: Stay at home, and trust no
knight.</p>

<p><b>M</b> smacks decidedly of the bänkelsänger, and has an appropriate
moral at the tail: <i>animi index cauda!</i> The characters are a cavalier
and a girl, both nameless, and a brother. The girl, hearing the knight
sing "ein Liedchen von dreierlei Stimmen," which should seem to
signify a three-part song, says, "Ah, could I sing like him, I would
straightway give him my honor." They ride to the wood, and come upon a
hazel-bush with <i>three</i> doves, one of which informs the maid that she
will be betrayed, the second that she will die that day, and the third
that she will be buried in the wood. The second and third doves, as
being false prophets, and for other reasons, may safely be pronounced
intruders. All is now lost till we come to the cries, which are
addressed to father, mother, and brother. The brother stabs the traitor
to the heart.<a name="FNanchor_1_48" id="FNanchor_1_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p><b>N</b> is as short as <b>M</b>, and, like it, has no names, but
has all the principal points: the fascinating song, the dove on the
bush, eleven maids in the fir, the three cries, and the rescue by the
huntsman-brother, who cocks his gun and shoots the knight. The reciter
of this ballad gave the editor to understand that if the robber had
succeeded in his twelfth murder, he would have attained such powers
that nobody after that could harm him.<a name="FNanchor_1_49" id="FNanchor_1_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p><b>O</b> is a fairly well-preserved ballad, resembling <b>G-J</b> as to
the course of the story. Anneli, lying under the casement, hears the
knight singing as he rides through the reeds. The elaborate toilet is
omitted, as in <b>I</b>, <b>J</b>. The knight makes haste to the dark
wood. They come to a cold spring, "mit Bluot war er überrunnen;" then
to a hazel, behind which a dove coos ominously. Anneli says, Listen.
The dove coos you are a false man, that will not spare my life. No,
says the knight, that is not it; the dove is cooing about its blue
foot, for its fate is to freeze in winter. The cloak is thrown on the
grass, the eleven maids in the fir are descried, and Anneli is told
she must hang highest, and be empress over all. He concedes her as
many cries as she likes, for only the wood-birds will hear. She calls
on God, the Virgin, and her brother. The brother thinks he hears his
sister's voice, calls to his groom to saddle, comes upon the knight
while he is twisting a withe for his horse, as he says, ties him to the
end of the withe, and makes him pay for all he has perpetrated in the
wood. He then swings Anneli behind him, and rides home with her.</p>

<p><b>P</b>, the other Swiss ballad, has been re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-35" id="Pg_1-35">[Pg 35]</a></span>touched, and more than
retouched in places, by a modern pen. Still the substance of the story,
and, on the whole, the popular tone, is preserved. Fair Anneli, in
the miller's house, hears the knight singing as he rides through the
rushes, and runs down-stairs and calls to him: she would go off with
him if she could sing like that, and her clothes are fit for any young
lady. The knight promises that he will teach her his song if she will
go with him, and bids her put these fine clothes on. They ride to
the wood. A dove calls from the hazel, "He will betray thee." Anneli
asks what the dove is saying, and is answered much as in <b>J</b> and
<b>O</b>, that it is talking about its frost-bitten feet and claws. The
knight tears through the wood, to the great peril of Anneli's gown and
limbs, and when he has come to the right place, spreads his cloak on
the grass, and makes the usual request. She weeps when she sees eleven
maids in the fir-tree, and receives the customary consolation:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Weep not too sore, my Anneli,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis true thou art doomed the twelfth to be;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up to the highest tip must thou go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a margravine be to all below;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must be an empress over the rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hang the highest of all as the best.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The request to be allowed three cries is lost. The knight tells her to
cry as much as she pleases, he knows no one will come; the wild birds
will not hear, and the doves are hushed. She cries to father, mother,
and brother. The brother, who is sitting over his wine at the inn,
hears, saddles his best horse, rides furiously, and comes first to a
spring filled with locks of maid's hair and red with maid's blood; then
to a bush, where the knight (Rüdeli, Rudolph) is twisting his withe. He
bids his sister be silent, for the withe is not for her; the villain is
twisting it for his own neck, and shall be dragged at the tail of his
horse.</p>

<p><b>Q</b> resembles the Swabian ballads, and presents only these
variations from the regular story. The dove adds to the warning, "Fair
maid, be not beguiled," what we find nowhere else, "Yonder I see a
cool spring, around which blood is running." The knight, to remove the
maid's anxiety, says, "Let it talk; it does not know me; I am no such
murderer." The end is excessively feeble. When the brother, a hunter as
before, reaches his sister, "a robber runs away," and then the brother
takes her by the hand, conducts her to her father's land, and enjoins
her to stay at home and spin silk. There are no names.</p>

<p>There is one feature entirely peculiar to <b>R</b>. The knight carries
off the maid, as before, but when they come to the hazel bush there are
eleven doves that sing this "new song:"</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Be not beguiled, maiden,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The knight is beguiling thee:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'We are eleven already,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou shalt be the twelfth.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The eleven doves are of course the spirits of the eleven preceding
victims. The maid's inquiry as to what they mean is lost. The knight's
evasion is not ingenious, but more likely to allay suspicion than
simply saying, "I am no such murderer." He says, "Fear not: the doves
are singing a song that is common in these parts." When they come to
the spring "where blood and water are running," and the maid asks what
strange spring is this, the knight answers in the same way, and perhaps
could not do better: "Fear not: <i>there is</i> in these parts a spring that
runs blood and water." This spring is misplaced, for it occurs before
they enter the wood. The last scene in the ballad is incomplete, and
goes no further than the brother's exclamation when he comes in upon
the knight: "Stop, young knight! Spare my sister's life." The parties
in <b>R</b> are nameless.</p>

<p>So again in <b>S</b>, which also has neither the knight's enchanting
song nor the bloody spring. There are two doves, as in <b>J</b>, stanza
4. The cries are addressed to mother, father, brother, as in <b>N</b>,
and, as in <b>N</b>, again, the brother cocks his gun, and shoots the
knight down;<a name="FNanchor_1_50" id="FNanchor_1_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> then calmly leads his sister home, with the warning
against knights. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-36" id="Pg_1-36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>(III.) <b>T</b>, the first of the third series, has marked signs of
deterioration. Ulrich does not enchant Ännchen by his song, and promise
to teach it to her; he offers to teach her "bird-song." They <i>walk</i> out
together, apparently, and come to a hazel, with no dove; neither is
there any spring. Annie sits down on the grass; Ulrich lays his head
in her lap; she weeps, and he asks why. It is for eleven maids in the
fir-tree, as so often before. Ulrich's style has become much tamer:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Ah, Annie, Annie, dear to me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How soon shalt thou the twelfth one be!'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She begs for three cries, and calls to her father, to God, to her
youngest brother. The last is sitting over the wine and hears. He
demands of Ulrich where she is, and is told, Upon yon linden, spinning
silk. Then ensues this dialogue: Why are your shoes blood-red? Why not?
I have shot a dove. That dove my mother bare under her breast. Annie is
laid in the grave, and angels sing over her; Ulrich is broken on the
wheel, and round him the ravens cry.</p>

<p>There is no remnant or reminiscence of the magical singing in
<b>U</b>. Schön Ulrich and Roth Ännchen go on a walk, and come first
to a fir-tree, then a green mead. The next scene is exactly as in
<b>T</b>. Ulrich says the eleven maids were his wives, and that he had
thrust his sword through their hearts. Annie asks for three <i>sighs</i>,
and directs them to God, to Jesus, and to her youngest brother. He
is sitting over his wine, when the sigh comes into the window, and
Ulrich simultaneously in at the door. The remainder is very much as in
<b>T</b>.</p>

<p><b>V</b> differs from <b>U</b> only in the names, which are
Schön-Heinrich and Schön-Ännelein, and in the "sighs" returning to
cries, which invoke God, father, and brother.</p>

<p><b>W</b> begins with a rivalry between Ulrich and Hanselein<a name="FNanchor_1_51" id="FNanchor_1_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> for
the hand of Rautendelein (Rautendchen). Ulrich is successful. She
packs up her jewels, and he takes her to a wood, where she sees eleven
maids hanging. He assures her she shall presently be the twelfth. It
is then they sit down, and she leans her head on his breast and weeps,
"because," as she says, "I must die." His remark upon this, if there
was any, is lost. Hoffmann inserts a stanza from another Silesian copy,
in which Ulrich says, Rather than spare thy life, I will run an iron
stake through thee. She asks for three cries, and he says, Four, if
you want. She prefers four, and calls to her father, mother, sister,
brother. The brother, as he sits over the wine, hears the cry, and
almost instantly Ulrich comes in at the door. He pretends to have
killed a dove; the brother knows what dove, and hews off Ulrich's head,
with a speech like that in <b>I</b>. Still, as Rautendchen is brought
to the grave, with toll of bells, so Ulrich is mounted on the wheel,
where ravens shriek over him.</p>

<p><b>X.</b> Albrecht and Hänselein woo Alalein. She is promised to
Albrecht, but Hänsel gets her. He takes her to a green mead, spreads
his mantle on the grass, and she sits down. His lying in her lap and
her discovery of the awful tree are lost. She weeps, and he tells her
she shall be "his eleventh." Her cries are condensed into one stanza:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Gott Vater, Sohn, Herr Jesu Christ,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mein jüngster Bruder, wo Du bist!'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Her brother rides in the direction of the voice, and meets Hänselein
in the wood, who says Alalein is sitting with princes and counts. The
conclusion is as in <b>T</b>, <b>U</b>, <b>V</b>.</p>

<p><b>Y</b> has Ansar Uleraich wooing a king's daughter, Annle, to the
eighth year. He takes her to a fir-wood, then to a fir, a stump of
a tree, a spring; in each case bidding her sit down. At the spring
he asks her if she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-37" id="Pg_1-37">[Pg 37]</a></span> wishes to be drowned, and, upon her saying no,
cuts off her head. He has not walked half a mile before he meets her
brother. The brother inquires where Ulrich has left his sister, and
the reply is, "By the green Rhine." The conclusion is as in <b>W</b>.
Ulrich loses his head, and the brother pronounces the imprecation which
is found there and in I.<a name="FNanchor_1_52" id="FNanchor_1_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p><b>Z</b>, which takes us back from Eastern Germany to the Rhine,
combines features from all the three groups. Ulrich fascinates a king's
daughter by his song. She collects her gold and jewels, as in <b>W</b>,
and goes to a wood, where a dove warns her that she will be betrayed.
Ulrich appropriates her valuables, and they wander about till they come
to the Rhine. There he takes her into a wood, and gives her a choice
between hanging and drowning, and, she declining both, says she shall
die by his sword. But first she is allowed three cries,&mdash;to God, her
parents, her youngest brother. The youngest brother demands of Ulrich
where he has left his sister. "Look in my pocket, and you shall find
fourteen tongues, and the last cut [reddest] of all is your sister's."
The words were scarcely out of his mouth before Ulrich's sword had
taken off his head.</p>

<p>The three classes of the German ballad, it will be observed, have for
their principal distinction that in I the maid saves her own life by
an artifice, and takes the life of her treacherous suitor; in II, she
is rescued by her brother, who also kills the traitor; in III, she
dies by the villain's hand, and he by her brother's, or by a public
execution. There are certain subordinate traits which are constant,
or nearly so, in each class. In I, <b>A-F</b>, a choice of deaths is
invariably offered; the maid gets the advantage of the murderer by
persuading him to take off his coat [distorted in <b>F</b>, which has
lost its conclusion]; and, on her way home, she falls in with one or
more of the robber's family, mother, brothers, servant, who interrogate
her [except <b>F</b>, which, as just said, is a fragment]. Class II
has several marks of its own. All the thirteen ballads [<b>G-S</b>],
except the last, represent the knight as fascinating the maid by his
singing; in all but <b>Q</b> she is warned of her danger by a dove,<a name="FNanchor_1_53" id="FNanchor_1_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
or more than one; in all but the much-abridged <b>M</b>, <b>N</b>, the
knight spreads his cloak on the grass, they sit down, and, excepting
<b>M</b>, <b>N</b>, <b>R</b>, the unromantic service is repeated which
she undertakes in Danish <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>,
<b>F</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>L</b>, Swedish <b>A</b>, Norwegian <b>A</b>,
<b>B</b>. The bloody spring occurs in some form, though often not quite
intelligible, in <b>H</b>, <b>J</b>, <b>K</b>, <b>L</b>, <b>O</b>,
<b>P</b>, <b>Q</b>, <b>R</b> (also in <b>D</b>, <b>Y</b>). All but
the much-abridged <b>M</b>, <b>N</b> have the question, What are you
weeping for? your father's land, humbled pride, lost honor? etc.;
but this question recurs in <b>T</b>, <b>U</b>, <b>V</b>, <b>W</b>.
The cries for help are a feature of both the second and the third
class, and are wanting only in <b>Y</b>. Class III differs from I, and
resembles II, in having the cries for help, and, in the less impaired
forms, <b>T-W</b>, the knight spreads his cloak, lies down with his
head in the lady's lap, and asks the cause of her tears. Beyond this,
and the changed catastrophe, the ballads of Class III are distinguished
by what they have lost.</p>

<p>Forms in which the story of this is mixed with that of some other
German ballad remain to be noticed.</p>

<p><b>A.</b> A ballad first published in Nicolai's Almanach, <span class="smcap">II</span>,
100, No 21 (1778), and since reprinted, under the titles, 'Liebe ohne
Stand,' 'Der Ritter und die Königstochter,' etc., but never with
absolute fidelity, in Wunderhorn (1819), <span class="smcap">I</span>, 37 (== Erlach,
<span class="smcap">II</span>, 120), Kretzschmer, No 72, <span class="smcap">I</span>, 129; Mittler, No
89; Erk, Neue Sammlung, iii, 18, No 14; also, with a few changes, by
Zuccalmaglio, No. 95, p. 199, as 'aus Schwaben;' by Erk, Liederhort,
No 28, p. 90, as "corrected from oral tradition;" and as "from oral
tradition," in Erk's Wunderhorn (1857), <span class="smcap">I</span>, 39. Independent
versions are given by Mittler, No 90, p. 83, from Oberhessen;
Pröhle, Weltliche u. geistliche Volkslieder, No 5, p. 10, from
the Harz; Reifferscheid, No 18, p. 36, from Bökendorf. Erk refers
to still another copy, five stanzas longer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-38" id="Pg_1-38">[Pg 38]</a></span> than Nicolai's, from
Hesse-Darmstadt, Neue Sammlung, iii, 19, note.</p>

<p>What other ballad is here combined with Ulinger, it is impossible to
make out. The substance of the narrative is that a knight rides singing
through the reeds, and is heard by a king's daughter, who forthwith
desires to go with him. They ride till the horse is hungry [tired];
he spreads his cloak on the grass, and makes, <i>sans façon</i>, his usual
request. The king's daughter sheds many tears, and he asks why. "Had I
followed my father's counsel, I might have been empress." The knight
cuts off her head at the word, and says, Had you held your tongue, you
would have kept your head. He throws the body behind a tree, with Lie
there and rot; my young heart must mourn [no knight, a knight, shall
mourn over thee]. Another stanza or two, found in some versions, need
not be particularly noticed.</p>

<p>'Stolz Sieburg,' Simrock, No 8, p. 21, from the Rhine, Mittler, No
88, is another and somewhat more rational form of the same story. To
the question whether she is weeping for Gut, Muth, Ehre, the king's
daughter answers:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Ich wein um meine Ehre,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ich wollt gern wieder umkehren.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>For this Stolz Sieburg strikes off her head, with a speech like that
which we have just had, and throws it into a spring; then resolves to
hang himself.<a name="FNanchor_1_54" id="FNanchor_1_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>A <b>Dutch</b> version of this ballad, Le Jeune, No 92, p. 292;
Willems, No 72, p. 186; Hoffmann, No 29, p. 92, has less of the Halewyn
in it, and more motive than the German, though less romance. "If you
might have been an empress," says the knight, "I, a margrave's son,
will marry you to-morrow." "I would rather lose my head than be your
wife," replies the lady; upon which he cuts off her head and throws
it into a fountain, saying, Lie there, smiling mouth! Many a thousand
pound have you cost me, and many pence of red gold. Your head is clean
cut off.</p>

<p><b>B.</b> The Ulinger story is also found combined with that of the
beautiful ballad, 'Wassermanns Braut.'<a name="FNanchor_1_55" id="FNanchor_1_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> (1.) In a Transylvanian
ballad, 'Brautmörder,' Schuster, Siebenbürgisch-sächsische Volkslieder,
p. 57, No 54 <b>A</b>, 38 vv, with variations, and p. 59, <b>B</b>, a
fragment of 10 vv; (<b>A</b> in a translation, Böhme, No 14, p. 61.) A
king from the Rhine sues seven years for a king's daughter, and does
not prevail till the eighth. She begs her mother not to consent, for
she has seen it in the sun that she shall not long be her daughter, in
the moon that she shall drown before the year is out, in the bright
stars that her blood shall be dispersed far and wide. He takes her by
the hand, and leads her through a green wood, at the end of which a
grave is already made. He pushes her into the grave, and drives a stake
through her heart. The princess' brother asks what has become of his
sister. "I left her on the Rhine, drinking mead and wine." "Why are
your skirts so bloody?" "I have shot a turtle-dove." "That turtle-dove
was, mayhap, my sister." They spit him on a red-hot stake, and roast
him like a fish. Lines 1-4 of this ballad correspond to 1-4 of <b>Y</b>
(which last agree with 1-4 of Meinert's 'Wassermanns Braut'); 17, 18,
to <b>Y</b> 5, 6; 25-34 to 21-30; and we find in verse 22 the stake
through the heart which Hoffmann has interpolated in <b>W</b>, stanza
12.</p>

<p>(2.) A Silesian copy of 'Wassermanns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-39" id="Pg_1-39">[Pg 39]</a></span> Braut,' co[llecte]d by [Ho]ffman
contributed to Deutsches Museum, 1852, <span class="smcap">II</span>, 164, represents the
bride, after she has fallen into the water and has been recovered by
the nix, as asking for three cries, and goes on from this point like
the Ulrich ballad <b>W</b>, the conclusion being that the sister is
drowned before the brother comes to her aid.<a name="FNanchor_1_56" id="FNanchor_1_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>'Nun schürz dich, Gredlein,' "Forster's Frische Liedlein, No 66,"
Böhme, No 53, Uhland, No 256 A, which is of the date 1549, and
therefore older than the Nuremberg and Augsburg broadsides, has derived
stanzas 7-9 from an Ulinger ballad, unless this passage is to be
regarded as common property. Some copies of the ballad commonly called
'Müllertücke' have also adopted verses from Ulinger, especially that in
Meier's Schwäbische Volkslieder, No 233, p. 403.</p>

<p>A form of ballad resembling English <b>C-F</b>, but with some important
differences, is extraordinarily diffused in <b>Poland</b>. There
is also a single version of the general type of English <b>A</b>,
or, better, of the first class of the German ballads. This version,
<b>A</b>, Pauli, Pie&#347;&#324;i ludu Polskiego w Galicyi, p. 90, No 5,
and Kolberg, Pie&#347;ni ludu Polskiego, No 5, <b>bbb</b>, p. 70, runs
thus. There was a man who went about the world wiling away young girls
from father and mother. He had already done this with eight; he was
now carrying off the ninth. He took her to a frightful wood; then bade
her look in the direction of her house. She asked, "What is that white
thing that I see on yon fir?" "There are already eight of them," he
said, "and you shall be the ninth; never shall you go back to your
father and mother. Take off that gown, Maria." Maria was looking at
his sword. "Don't touch, Maria, for you will wound your pretty little
hands." "Don't mind my hands, John," she replied, "but rather see what
a bold heart I have;" and instantly John's head flew off. Then follows
a single stanza, which seems to be addressed to John's mother, after
the manner of the German <b>A</b>, etc.: "See, dear mother! I am thy
daughter-in-law, who have just put that traitor out of the world."
There is a moral for conclusion, which is certainly a later addition.</p>

<p>The story of the larger part of these ballads, conveyed as briefly as
possible, is this: John, who is watering horses, urges Catherine,<a name="FNanchor_1_58" id="FNanchor_1_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
who is drawing water, to elope with him. He bids her take silver and
gold enough, that the horse may have something to carry. Catherine
says her mother will not allow her to enter the new chamber. Tell her
that you have a headache, says John, and she will consent. Catherine
feigns a headache, is put into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-40" id="Pg_1-40">[Pg 40]</a></span> the new chamber, and absconds with John
while her mother is asleep.<a name="FNanchor_1_59" id="FNanchor_1_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> At a certain stage, more commonly at
successive stages,&mdash;on the high road, <b>K</b>, <b>P</b>, <b>S</b>,
<b>DD</b>, <b>II</b>, <b>LL</b>, in a dark wood, <b>D</b>, <b>P</b>,
<b>T</b>, <b>X</b>, <b>Z</b>, <b>DD</b>, <b>EE</b>, at a spring,
<b>D</b>, <b>K</b>, <b>S</b>, <b>T</b>, <b>V</b>, <b>W</b>, <b>X</b>,
<b>Y</b>, <b>Z</b>, <b>EE</b>, <b>II</b>, <b>LL</b>, etc.,&mdash;he bids
her take off, or himself takes from her, her "rich attire," <b>D</b>,
<b>P</b>, <b>T</b>, <b>V</b>, <b>W</b>, <b>X</b>, <b>Y</b>, <b>Z</b>,
<b>DD</b>, <b>EE</b>, her satin gown, <b>D</b>, <b>T</b>, <b>X</b>,
<b>DD</b>, <b>EE</b>, her French or Turkish costume, <b>K</b>,
<b>P</b>, <b>II</b>, robes of silver, <b>K</b>, shoes, <b>Z</b>,
<b>CC</b>, <b>FF</b>, silk stockings, <b>T</b>, corals, <b>D</b>,
<b>X</b>, <b>CC</b>, <b>EE</b>, pearls, <b>T</b>, rings, <b>K</b>,
<b>O-T</b>, <b>X</b>, <b>Z</b>, <b>CC-FF</b>, <b>II</b>, <b>LL</b>. In
many of the ballads he tells her to go back to her mother, <b>B-G</b>,
<b>K</b>, <b>L*</b>, <b>M</b>, <b>N</b>, <b>Q</b>, <b>S</b>, <b>U</b>,
<b>X</b>, <b>Y</b>, <b>EE</b>, <b>HH-LL</b>, sometimes after pillaging
her, sometimes without mention of this. Catherine generally replies
that she did not come away to have to go back, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>,
<b>D</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>L*</b>, <b>M</b>, <b>S</b>, <b>U</b>, <b>X</b>,
<b>Y</b>, <b>EE</b>, <b>HH</b>, <b>JJ</b>, <b>KK</b>, <b>LL</b>. John
seizes her by the hands and sides and throws her into a deep river
[pool, water, sea]. Her apron [tress, <b>AA</b>, <b>II</b>, both apron
and tress, <b>O</b>, petticoat, <b>KK</b>] is caught on a stake or
stump of a tree, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>I</b>,
<b>O</b>, <b>P</b>, <b>R</b>, <b>T</b>, <b>U</b>, <b>V</b>, <b>W</b>,
<b>Y</b>, <b>BB</b>, <b>DD</b>, <b>EE</b>, <b>II</b>, <b>JJ</b>,
<b>KK</b> [in a bush <b>D</b>]. John cuts it away with axe or sword,
<b>G</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>O</b>, <b>R</b>, <b>T</b>, <b>BB</b>, <b>II</b>,

you in to help you out,"<a name="FNanchor_1_60" id="FNanchor_1_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>P</b>,

Catherine is drawn ashore in a fisherman's net [swims ashore <b>I</b>,
<b>J</b>, <b>GG</b>].</p>

<p>Catherine comes out from the water alive in <b>B-N</b>. The brother
who plays so important a part in the second class of German ballads,
appears also in a few of the Polish versions, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>,
<b>D</b>, and <b>L*</b>, <b>O</b>, <b>P</b>, <b>Q</b>, <b>X</b>,
but is a mere shadow. In <b>B</b> 21, 22, and <b>C</b> 16, 17, the
brother, who is "on the mountain," and may be supposed to hear the
girl's cry, slides down a silken cord, which proves too short, and
the girl "adds her tress"! He asks the fishermen to throw their nets
for her. She is rescued, goes to church, takes an humble place behind
the door, and, when her eyes fall on the young girls, melts into
tears. Her apron catches in a bush in <b>D</b>: she plucks a leaf, and
sends it down the stream to her mother's house. The mother says to
the father, "Do you not see how Catherine is perishing?" The leaf is
next sent down stream to her sister's house, who says to her brother,
"Do you not see how Catherine is perishing?" He rides up a high
mountain, and slides down his silken cord. Though one or two stanzas
are lost, or not given, the termination was probably the same as in
<b>B</b>, <b>C</b>. In <b>L*</b> 15, <b>O</b> 12, the brother, on a
high mountain, hears the cry for help, and slides down to his sister
on a silken cord, but does nothing. <b>X</b> does not account for the
brother's appearance: he informs the fishermen of what has happened,
and they draw Catherine out, evidently dead. The brother hears the cry
from the top of a wall in <b>P</b> 21, 22; slides down his cord; the
sister adds her tress; he directs the fishermen to draw her out; she is
dead. Instead of the brother on the wall, we have a mason in <b>Q</b>
27 [perhaps "the brother on the wall" in <b>P</b> <i>is</i> a mason]. It
is simply said that "he added" a silken cord: the fishermen drew out
Catherine dead. The conclusion is equally, or more, impotent in all
the versions in which the girl escapes from drowning. In <b>G</b>,
<b>I</b>, <b>J</b>, she seats herself on a stone, and apostrophizes
her hair, saying [in <b>G</b>, <b>I</b>], "Dry, my locks, dry, for
you have had much pleasure in the river!" She goes to church, takes
an humble place, and weeps, in <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>, as in
<b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>. John goes scot-free in all these.<a name="FNanchor_1_61" id="FNanchor_1_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> Not
so in the more vigorous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-41" id="Pg_1-41">[Pg 41]</a></span> ballads of tragic termination. Fierce pursuit
is made for him. He is cut to pieces, or torn to pieces, <b>O</b>,
<b>P</b>, <b>S</b>, <b>T</b>, <b>Y</b>; broken on the wheel, <b>L</b>,
<b>U</b>, <b>V</b>, <b>W</b>; cleft in two, <b>BB</b>; broken small as
barley-corns, or quartered, by horses, <b>L*</b>, <b>Z</b>; committed
to a dungeon, to await, as we may hope, one of these penalties,
<b>Q</b>, <b>R</b>. The bells toll for Catherine [the organs play for
her], and she is laid in the grave, <b>O-W</b>, <b>Y</b>, <b>Z</b>,
<b>L</b>, <b>L*</b>.</p>

<p>There are, besides, in various ballads of this second class, special
resemblances to other European forms. The man (to whom rank of any sort
is assigned only in <b>N</b><a name="FNanchor_1_62" id="FNanchor_1_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>) comes from a distant country, or from
over the border, in <b>O</b>, <b>Q</b>, <b>R</b>, <b>T</b>, <b>DD</b>,
<b>GG</b>, as in English <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>. The maid is at a window
in <b>M</b>, <b>W</b>, as in German <b>G</b>, <b>J</b>, <b>M</b>,
<b>O</b>, <b>P</b>, <b>Q</b>, etc. In <b>Q</b> 2, John, who has come
from over the border, persuades the maid to go with him by telling
her that in his country "the mountains are golden, the mountains are
of gold, the ways of silk," reminding us of the wonderland in Danish
<b>A</b>, <b>E</b>, etc. After the pair have stolen away, they go one
hundred and thirty miles, <b>O</b>, <b>DD</b>, <b>FF</b>; thrice nine
miles, <b>Q</b>; nine and a half miles, <b>T</b>; cross one field and
another, <b>M</b>, <b>R</b>; travel all night, <b>GG</b>; and neither
says a word to the other. We shall find this trait further on in French
<b>B</b>, <b>D</b>, Italian <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>F</b>,
<b>G</b>. The choice of deaths which we find in German <b>A-F</b>
appears in <b>J</b>. Here, after passing through a silent wood, they
arrive at the border of the (red) <i>sea</i>. She sits down on a stone,
he on a rotten tree. He asks, By which death will you die: by my
right hand, or by drowning in this <i>river</i>? They come to a dark wood
in <b>AA</b>; he seats himself on a beech-trunk, she near a stream.
He asks, Will you throw yourself into the river, or go home to your
mother? So <b>H</b>, and <b>R</b> nearly.<a name="FNanchor_1_63" id="FNanchor_1_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> She prefers death to
returning. Previous victims are mentioned in <b>T</b>, <b>DD</b>,
<b>HH</b>. When she calls from the river for help, he answers, <b>T</b>
22, You fancy you are the only one there; six have gone before, and you
are the seventh: <b>HH</b> 16, Swim the river; go down to the bottom;
six maids are there already, and you shall be the seventh [four,
fifth]: <b>DD</b> 13, Swim, swim away, to the other side; there you
will see my seventh wife.<a name="FNanchor_1_64" id="FNanchor_1_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>Other Slavic forms of this ballad resemble more or less the third
German class. A <b>Wendish</b> version from Upper Lusatia, Haupt and
Schmaler, Part I, No I, p. 27, makes Hil&#382;i&#269;ka (Lizzie) go out
before dawn to cut grass. Ho&#322;dra&#353;k suddenly appears, and says she
must pay him some forfeit for trespassing in his wood. She has nothing
but her sickle, her silver finger-ring, and, when these are rejected,
her wreath, and that, she says, he shall not have if she dies for it.
Ho&#322;dra&#353;k, who avows that he has had a fancy for her seven years
(cf. German <b>Y</b>, and the Transylvanian mixed form <b>B</b>), gives
her her choice, to be cut to pieces by his sword, or trampled to death
by his horse. Which way pleases him, she says, only she begs for three
cries. All three are for her brothers. They ride round the wood twice,
seeing nobody; the third time Ho&#322;drak comes up to them. Then follows
the dialogue about the bloody sword and the dove. When asked where he
has left Hi&#322;&#382;i&#269;ka, Ho&#322;dra&#353;k is silent. The elder brother
seizes him, the younger dispatches him with his sword.</p>

<p>Very similar is a <b>Bohemian</b> ballad, translated in Waldau's
Böhmische Granaten, <span class="smcap">II</span>, 25.<a name="FNanchor_1_65" id="FNanchor_1_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> While Katie is cutting grass,
early in the morning, Indriasch presents himself, and demands some for
his horse. She says, You must dismount, if your horse is to have grass.
"If I do, I will take away your wreath." "Then God will not grant you
his blessing." He springs from his horse, and while he gives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-42" id="Pg_1-42">[Pg 42]</a></span> it grass
with one hand snatches at the wreath with the other. "Will you die,
or surrender your wreath?" Take my life, she says, but allow me three
cries. Two cries reached no human ear, but the third cry her mother
heard, and called to her sons to saddle, for Katie was calling in the
wood, and was in trouble. They rode over stock and stone, and came
to a brook where Indriasch was washing his hands. The same dialogue
ensues as in the Wendish ballad. The brothers hewed the murderer into
fragments.</p>

<p>A <b>Servian</b> ballad has fainter but unmistakable traces of the
same tradition: Vuk, Srpske Narodne Pjesme, <span class="smcap">I</span>, 282, No 385,
ed. 1841; translated by Goetze, Serbische V. L., p. 99, by Talvj,
V. L. der Serben, 2d ed., <span class="smcap">II</span>, 172, by Kapper, Gesänge der
Serben, <span class="smcap">II</span>, 318. Mara is warned by her mother not to dance
with Thomas. She disobeys. Thomas, while dancing, gives a sign to his
servants to bring horses. The two ride off, and when they come to the
end of a field Thomas says, Seest thou yon withered maple? There thou
shalt hang, ravens eat out thine eyes, eagles beat thee with their
wings. Mara shrieks, Ah me! so be it with every girl that does not take
her mother's advice.<a name="FNanchor_1_66" id="FNanchor_1_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p><b>French.</b> This ballad is well known in France, and is generally
found in a form resembling the English; that is to say, the scene of
the attempted murder is the sea or a river (as in no other but the
Polish), and the lady delivers herself by an artifice. One French
version nearly approaches Polish <b>O-CC</b>.</p>

<p><b>A.</b> 'Renauld et ses quatorze Femmes,' 44 vv, Paymaigre, Chants
populaires recueillis dans le pays messin, No 31, <span class="smcap">I</span>, 140.
Renauld carried off the king's daughter. When they were gone half-way,
she called to him that she was dying of hunger (cf. German <b>A-F</b>).
Eat your hand, he answered, for you will never eat bread again. When
they had come to the middle of the wood, she called out that she was
dying of thirst. Drink your blood, he said, for you will never drink
wine again. When they came to the edge of the wood, he said, Do you see
that river? Fourteen dames have been drowned there, and you shall be
the fifteenth. When they came to the river-bank, he bade her put off
her cloak, her shift. It is not for knights, she said, to see ladies in
such plight; they should bandage their eyes with a handkerchief. This
Renauld did, and the fair one threw him into the river. He laid hold of
a branch; she cut it off with his sword (cf. the Polish ballad, where
the catastrophe, and consequently this act, is reversed). "What will
they say if you go back without your lover?" "I will tell them that I
did for you what you meant to do for me."<a name="FNanchor_1_67" id="FNanchor_1_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> "Reach me your hand; I
will marry you Sunday."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Marry, marry a fish, Renauld,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fourteen women down below."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><b>B.</b> 'De Dion et de la Fille du Roi,' from Auvergne, Ampère,
Instructions, etc., 40 vv, p. 40, stanzas 15-24, the first fourteen
constituting another ballad.<a name="FNanchor_1_68" id="FNanchor_1_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> The pair went five or six leagues
without exchanging a word; only the fair one said, I am so hungry I
could eat my fist. Eat it, replied Dion, for you never again will eat
bread. Then they went five or six leagues in silence, save that she
said, I am so thirsty I could drink my blood. "Drink it, for you never
will drink wine. Over there is a pond in which fifteen ladies have had
a bath, have drowned themselves, and you will make sixteen." Arrived
at the pond, he orders her to take off her clothes. She tells him to
put his sword under his feet, his cloak before his face, and turn to
the pond; and, when he has done so, pushes him in. Here are my keys!
he cries. "I don't want them; I will find locksmiths." "What will your
friends say?" "I will tell them I did by you as you would have done by
me."</p>

<p><b>C.</b> 'Veux-tu venir, bell' Jeanneton,' 32 vv,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-43" id="Pg_1-43">[Pg 43]</a></span> from Poitou and
Aunís, Bujeaud, <span class="smcap">II</span>, 232. When they reach the water, the
fair one asks for a drink. The man says, incoherently enough, Before
drinking of this white wine I mean to drink your blood. The stanza
that should tell how many have been drowned before is lost. Jeanneton,
having been ordered to strip, pushes the "beau galant" into the sea,
while, at her request, he is pulling off her stockings. He catches at a
branch; she cuts it off, and will not hear to his entreaties.</p>

<p><b>D.</b> 'En revenant de la jolie Rochelle,' twelve two-line stanzas,
Gagnon, Chansons populaires du Canada, p. 155. A cavalier meets three
fair maids, mounts the fairest behind him, and rides a hundred leagues
without speaking to her, at the end of which she asks to drink. He
takes her to a spring, but when there she does not care to drink. The
rest of the ballad is pointless, and shows that the original story has
been completely forgotten.</p>

<p><b>E.</b> 'Belle, allons nous épromener,' from the Lyonnais, 28 vv,
Champfleury, Chansons des Provinces, p. 172, is like <b>C</b>, but
still more defective. The pair go to walk by "la mer courante."
There is no order for the lady to strip: on the contrary, she cries,
Déshabillez-moi, déchaussez-moi! and, while the man is drawing off
her shoe, "la belle avance un coup de pied, le beau galant tombe dans
l'eau."</p>

<p><b>F.</b> 'Allons, mie, nous promener,' 32 vv, Poésies populaires de
la France, MS., <span class="smcap">III</span>, fol. 84, No 16, is like <b>C</b>. The
lady asks the man to pull off her shoes before he kills her. The man
clutches a branch; the woman cuts it away.</p>

<p><b>G.</b> 'Le Traître Noyé,' Chants pop. du Velay et du Forez, Romania,
<span class="smcap">X</span>, 199, is like <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>.</p>

<p><b>H.</b> 'La Fillette et le Chevalier,' Victor Smith, Chants pop. du
Velay et du Forez, Romania, X, 198, resembles the common Polish ballad.
Pierre rouses his love early in the morning, to take a ride with him.
He mounts her on his horse, and when they come to a lonesome wood bids
her alight, for it is the last of her days. He plunges his sword into
her heart, and throws her into a river. Her father and mother come
searching for her, and are informed of her fate by a shepherdess, who
had witnessed the murder. The youngest of her three brothers plunges
into the water, exclaiming, Who threw you in? An angel descends, and
tells him it was her lover. A less romantic version, described in a
note, treats of a valet who is tired of an amour with a servant-girl.
He is judicially condemned to be hanged <i>or</i> burned.</p>

<p>'La Fille de Saint-Martin de l'Ile,' Bujeaud, <span class="smcap">II</span>, 226, has
the conclusion of the third class of German ballads. A mother incites
her son to make away with his wife. He carries her off on his horse to
a wheat-field [wood], and kills her with sword and dagger. Returning,
he meets his wife's brother, who asks why his shoes are covered with
blood. He says he has been killing rabbits. The brother replies, I
see by your paleness that you have been killing my sister. So Gérard
de Nerval, Les Filles du Feu, &#338;uvres Com., <span class="smcap">V</span>, 134, and La
Bohème galante (1866), p. 79: 'Rosine,' Chants pop. du Velay, etc.,
Romania, <span class="smcap">X</span>, 197.</p>

<p>The ballad is known over all <b>North Italy</b>, and always nearly in
one shape.</p>

<p><b>A.</b> 'Monchisa,' sixty-four short verses, Bernoni, Canti popolari
veneziani, Puntata v, No 2. A count's son asks Monchesa, a knight's
daughter, in marriage in the evening, espouses her in the morning, and
immediately carries her off. When they are "half-way," she heaves a
sigh, which she says is for father and mother, whom she shall no more
see. The count points out his castle; he has taken thirty-six maids
there, robbed them of their honor, and cut off their heads. "So will
I do with you when we are there." The lady says no word till she is
asked why she is silent; then requests the count to lend her his sword;
she wishes to cut a branch to shade her horse. The moment she gets the
sword in her hand, she plunges it into his heart; then throws the body
into a ditch. On her way back, she meets her brother, whom she tells
that she is looking after the assassins who have killed her husband. He
fears it was she; this she denies, but afterwards says she must go to
Rome to confess a great sin. There she obtains prompt absolution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-44" id="Pg_1-44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p><b>B.</b> 'La Figlia del Conte,' Adolf Wolf, Volkslieder aus Venetien,
No 73, <b>a</b>, 34 vv, <b>b</b>, 48 vv. Here it is the daughter of
a count that marries Malpreso, the son of a knight. He takes her to
France immediately. She goes sixty miles (<b>b</b>) without speaking.
She confesses to her brother what she has done.</p>

<p><b>C.</b> Righi, Canti popolari veronesi, 58 vv, No 94*, p. 30. The
count's son marries Mampresa, a knight's daughter. For thirty-six
miles she does not speak; after five more she sighs. She denies to her
brother having killed her husband, but still says she must go to the
pope to confess an old sin; then owns what she has done.</p>

<p><b>D.</b> 'La Monferrina,' 48 vv, Nigra, Canzoni popolari del Piemonte,
in Rivista Contemporanea, <span class="smcap">XXIV</span>, 76. The lady is a Monferrina,
daughter of a knight. After the marriage they travel fifty miles
without speaking to one another. Fifty-two Monferrine have lost their
heads; the bridegroom does not say why. She goes to the Pope to confess.</p>

<p><b>E.</b> 'La Vendicatrice,' an incomplete copy from Alexandria, 18 vv
only, Marcoaldi, Canti popolari, No 12, p. 166, like <b>D</b>, as far
as it goes. Thirty-three have been beheaded before.</p>

<p><b>F.</b> 'La Inglese,' 40 vv, Ferraro, Canti popolari di Ferrara,
Cento e Pontelagoscuro, No 2, p. 14. The count's son marries an English
girl, daughter of a knight. She never speaks for more than three
hundred miles; after two hundred more she sighs. She denies having
killed her husband; has not a heart of that kind.</p>

<p><b>G.</b> 'La Liberatrice,' 24 vv, Ferraro, Canti popolari monferrini,
No 3, p. 4. Gianfleisa is the lady's name. When invited to go off, she
says, If you wish me to go, lend me a horse. Not a word is spoken for
five hundred miles. The man (Gilardu) points out his castle, and says
that no one he has taken there has ever come back. Gianfleisa goes home
without meeting anybody.</p>

<p>'Laura,' Ferraro, C. p. di Pontelagoscuro, Rivista di Filologia
romanza, <span class="smcap">II</span>, 197, and C. p. di Ferrara, etc., p. 86, is a
mixture of this ballad with another. Cf. 'La Maledetta,' Ferraro, C. p.
monferrini, No 27, p. 35.</p>

<p>Several other French and Italian ballads have common points with
Renauld, Monchisa, etc., and for this have sometimes been improperly
grouped with them: e.g., 'La Fille des Sables,' Bujeaud, <span class="smcap">II</span>,
177 ff. A girl sitting by the water-side hears a sailor sing, and
asks him to teach her the song. He says, Come aboard, and I will.
He pushes off, and by and by she begins to weep.<a name="FNanchor_1_69" id="FNanchor_1_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> She says, My
father is calling me to supper. "You will sup with me." "My mother
is calling me to bed." "You will sleep with me." They go a hundred
leagues, and not a word said, and at last reach his father's castle.
When she is undressing, her lace gets into a knot. He suggests that his
sword would cut it. She plunges the sword into her heart. So 'Du Beau
Marinier,' Beaurepaire, p. 57 f, and Poésies populaires de la France,
MS., <span class="smcap">III</span>, fol. 59, No 4; 'L'Épée Libératrice,' V. Smith,
Chansons du Velay, etc., Romania, <span class="smcap">VII</span>, 69, nearly; also 'Il
Corsaro,' Nigra, Rivista Coutemporanea, <span class="smcap">XXIV</span>, p. 86 ff. In
'La Monferrina Incontaminata,' Ferraro, C. p. m., No 2, p. 3, a French
knight invites a girl to go off with him, and mounts her behind him.
They ride five hundred miles without speaking, then reach an inn, after
which the story is the same. So Bernoni, Puntata <span class="smcap">IX</span>, No 2. 'La
Fille du Patissier,' Paymaigre, No 30, p. 93, has the same conclusion.
All these, except 'La Fille des Sables,' make the girl ask for the
sword herself, and in all it is herself that she kills.</p>

<p>The <b>Spanish</b> preserves this ballad in a single form, the earliest
printed in any language, preceding, by a few years, even the German
broadsides <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>.</p>

<p>'Romance de Rico Franco,' 36 vv, "Cancionero de Romances, s. a., fol.
191: Canc. de Rom., ed. de 1550, fol. 202: ed. de 1555, fol. 296;"
Wolf and Hofmann, Primavera, No 119, <span class="smcap">II</span>, 22: Duran, No 296,
<span class="smcap">I</span>, 160: Grimm, p. 252: Depping and Galiano, 1844, <span class="smcap">II</span>,
167: Ochoa, p. 7. The king's huntsmen got no game, and lost the
falcons. They betook them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-45" id="Pg_1-45">[Pg 45]</a></span>selves to the castle of Maynes, where was a
beautiful damsel, sought by seven counts and three kings. Rico Franco
of Aragon carried her off by force. Nothing is said of a rest in a
wood, or elsewhere; but that something has dropped out here is shown
by the corresponding Portuguese ballad. The lady wept. Rico Franco
comforted her thus: If you are weeping for father and mother, you shall
never see them more; and if for your brothers, I have killed them all
three. I am not weeping for them, she said, but because I know not
what my fate is to be. Lend me your knife to cut the fringes from my
mantle, for they are no longer fit to wear. This Rico Franco did, and
the damsel thrust the knife into his breast. Thus she avenged father,
mother, and brothers.</p>

<p>A <b>Portuguese</b> ballad has recently been obtained from tradition
in the island of St. George, Azores, which resembles the Spanish
closely, but is even curter: <b>A</b>, 'Romance de Dom Franco,' 30 vv;
<b>B</b>, 'Dona Inez,' a fragment of 18 vv; Braga, Cantos populares
do Archipelago açoriano, No 48, p. 316, No 49, p. 317: Hartung's
Romanceiro, <span class="smcap">II</span>, 61, 63. Dona Inez was so precious in the eyes
of her parents that they gave her neither to duke nor marquis. A knight
who was passing [the Duke of Turkey, <b>B</b>] took a fancy to her,
and stole her away. When they came to the middle of the mountain ridge
on which Dona Inez lived, the knight stopped to rest, and she began to
weep. From this point Portuguese <b>A</b>, and <b>B</b> so far as it is
preserved, agree very nearly with the Spanish.<a name="FNanchor_1_70" id="FNanchor_1_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>Certain Breton ballads have points of contact with the Halewyn-Ulinger
class, but, like the French and Italian ballads mentioned on the
preceding page, have more important divergences, and especially the
characteristic distinction that the woman kills herself to preserve her
honor. 1. 'Jeanne Le Roux,' Luzel, <span class="smcap">I</span>, 324 ff, in two versions;
Poésies pop. de la France, MS., <span class="smcap">III</span>, fol. 182. The sieur La
Tremblaie attempts the abduction of Jeanne from the church immediately
after her marriage ceremony. As he is about to compel her to get up
on the crupper of his horse, she asks for a knife to cut her bridal
girdle, which had been drawn too tight. He gives her the choice of
three, and she stabs herself in the heart. La Tremblaie <i>remarks</i>, I
have carried off eighteen young brides, and Jeanne is the nineteenth,
words evidently taken from the mouth of a Halewyn, and not belonging
here. 2. Le Marquis de Coatredrez, Luzel, <span class="smcap">I</span>, 336 ff, meets
a young girl on the road, going to the pardon of Guéodet, and forces
her on to his horse. On the way and at his house she vainly implores
help. He takes her to the garden to gather flowers. She asks for his
knife to shorten the stems, and kills herself. Early in the morning
the door of the château is broken in by Kerninon, foster-brother of
the victim, who forces Coatredrez to fight, and runs him through. 3.
'Rozmelchon,' Luzel, <span class="smcap">I</span>, 308 ff, in three versions, and, 4,
'La Filleule de du Guesclin,' Villemarqué, Barzaz-Breiz, 6th ed., 212
ff, are very like 2. The wicked Rozmelchon is burned in his château
in Luzel's first copy; the other two do not bring him to punishment.
Villemarqué's villain is an Englishman, and has his head cloven by du
Guesclin. 5. 'Marivonnic,' Luzel, <span class="smcap">I</span>, 350 ff, a pretty young
girl, is carried off by an English vessel, the captain of which shows
himself not a whit behind the feudal seigneurs in ferocity. The young
girl throws herself into the water.</p>

<p><b>Magyar.</b> Five versions from recent traditions, all of
them interesting, are given in Arany and Gyulai's collection of
Hungarian popular poetry, 'Molnár Anna,' <span class="smcap">I</span>, 137 ff, Nos
1-5.<a name="FNanchor_1_71" id="FNanchor_1_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>&mdash;<b>A</b>, p. 141, No 3. A man, nameless here, but called in
the other versions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-46" id="Pg_1-46">[Pg 46]</a></span> Martin Ajgó, or Martin Sajgó, invites Anna Miller
to go off with him. She refuses; she has a young child and a kind
husband. "Come," he says; "I have six palaces, and will put you in the
seventh," and persists so long that he prevails at last. They went a
long way, till they came to the middle of a green wood. He asked her
to sit down in the shade of a branchy tree (so all); he would lie in
her lap, and she was to look into his head (a point found in all the
copies). But look not up into the tree, he said. He went to sleep (so
<b>B</b>, <b>D</b>); she looked up into the tree, and saw six fair
maids hanging there (so all but <b>E</b>). She thought to herself, He
will make me the seventh! (also <b>B</b>, <b>D</b>). A tear fell on
the face of the "brave sir," and waked him. You have looked up into
the tree, he said. "No, but three orphans passed, and I thought of my
child." He bade her go up into the tree. She was not used to go first,
she said. He led the way. She seized the opportunity, tore his sword
from its sheath (so <b>C</b>), and hewed off his head. She then wrapped
herself in his cloak, sprang upon his horse, and returned home, where
(in all the copies, as in this) she effected a reconcilement with her
husband. <b>B</b>, p. 138, No 2, agrees closely with the foregoing.
Martin Ajgó calls to Anna Miller to come with him a long way into the
wilderness (so <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>). He boasts of no palaces in this
version. He calls Anna a long time, tempts her a long time, drags her
on to his horse, and carries her off. The scene under the tree is
repeated. Anna pretends (so <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>) that the tear which
drops on Martin's face is dew from the tree, and he retorts, How can it
be dew from the tree, when the time is high noon? His sword falls out
of its sheath as he is mounting the tree, and he asks her to hand it
to him. She throws it up (so <b>E</b>), and it cuts his throat in two.
Rightly served, Martin Ajgó, she says: why did you lure me from home?
<b>C</b>, p. 144, No 4. Martin Sajgó tells Anna Miller that he has
six stone castles, and is building a seventh. It is not said that he
goes to sleep. As in <b>A</b>, Anna pulls his sword from the scabbard.
<b>D</b>, p. 146, No 5. Here reappears the very important feature of
the wonderland: "Come, let us go, Anna Miller, a long journey into the
wilderness, to a place that flows with milk and honey." Anna insists,
as before, that Martin shall go up the tree first. He puts down his
sword; she seizes it, and strikes off his head with one blow. <b>E</b>,
p. 137, No 1, is somewhat defective, but agrees essentially with the
others. Martin Ajgó calls Anna; she will not come; he carries her off.
He lets his sword fall as he is climbing, and asks Anna to hand it up
to him. She throws it up, as in <b>B</b>, and it cuts his back in two.</p>

<p>Neus, in his Ehstnische Volkslieder, maintains the affinity of
'Kallewisohnes Tod,' No 2, p. 5, with the Ulinger ballads, and even
of his Holepi with the Dutch Halewyn. The resemblance is of the most
distant, and what there is must be regarded as casual. The same of
the Finnish 'Kojoins Sohn,' Schröter, Finnische Runen, p. 114, 115;
'Kojosen Poika,' Lönnrot, Kanteletar, p. 279.</p>

<p>In places where a ballad has once been known, the story will often be
remembered after the verses have been wholly or partly forgotten, and
the ballad will be resolved into a prose tale, retaining, perhaps, some
scraps of verse, and not infrequently taking up new matter, or blending
with other traditions. Naturally enough, a ballad and an equivalent
tale sometimes exist side by side. It has already been mentioned
that Jamieson, who had not found this ballad in Scotland, had often
come upon the story in the form of a tale interspersed with verse.
Birlinger at one time (1860) had not been able to obtain the ballad in
the Swabian Oberland (where it has since been found in several forms),
but only a story agreeing essentially with the second class of German
ballads. According to this tradition, a robber, who was at the same
time a portentous magician, enticed the twelve daughters of a miller,
one after another, into a wood, and hanged eleven of them on a tree,
but was arrested by a hunter, the brother of the twelve, before he
could dispatch the last, and was handed over to justice. The object of
the murders was to obtain blood for magical purposes. This story had,
so to speak, natu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-47" id="Pg_1-47">[Pg 47]</a></span>ralized itself in the locality, and the place where
the robber's house had been and that where the tree had stood were
pointed out. The hunter-brother was by some conceived of as the Wild
Huntsman, and came to the rescue through the air with a fearful baying
of dogs. (Birlinger in Volksthümliches aus Schwaben, <span class="smcap">I</span>, 368,
No 592, and Germania, 1st Ser., <span class="smcap">V</span>, 372.)</p>

<p>The story of the German ballad <b>P</b> has attached itself to
localities in the neighborhood of Weissenbach, Aargau, and is told
with modifications that connect it with the history of the Guggi-, or
Schongauer-, bad. A rich man by lewd living had become a leper. The
devil put it into his head that he could be cured by bathing in the
blood of twelve [seven] pure maidens. He seized eleven at a swoop,
while they were on their way to church, and hanged them, and the next
day enticed away a miller's daughter, who was delivered from death as
in the ballad. A medicinal spring rose near the fatal tree. (Rochholz,
<span class="smcap">I</span>, 22.) No pure version of this ballad has been obtained in
the Harz region, though a mixed form has already been spoken of; but
'Der Reiter in Seiden,' Pröhle, Märchen für die Jugend, No 32, p. 136,
which comes from the western Harz, or from some place further north,
on the line between Kyffhaüser and Hamburg, is, roughly speaking, only
'Gert Olbert' turned into prose, with a verse or two remaining. 'Der
betrogene Betrüger,' from Mühlbach, Müller's Siebenbürgische Sagen, No
418, p. 309, has for its hero a handsome young man, addicted to women,
who obtains from the devil the power of making them follow his piping,
on the terms that every twelfth soul is to be the devil's share. He
had taken eleven to a wood, and hanged them on a tree after he had
satisfied his desire. The brother of a twelfth substituted himself
for his sister, dressed in her clothes, snatched the rope from the
miscreant, and ran him up on the nearest bough; upon which a voice was
heard in the wind, that cried The twelfth soul is mine. Grundtvig, in
his Engelske og skotske Folkeviser, p. 249, gives his recollections
of a story that he had heard in his youth which has a catastrophe
resembling that of English <b>C-F</b>. A charcoal burner had a way of
taking up women beside him on his wagon, and driving them into a wood,
where he forced them to take off their clothes, then killed them, and
sunk them with heavy stones in a deep moss. At last a girl whom he
had carried off in this way got the advantage of him by inducing him
to turn away while she was undressing, and then pushing him into the
moss. Something similar is found in the conclusion of a robber story in
Grundtvig's Danske Folkeminder, 1861, No 30, p. 108, and in a modern
Danish ballad cited in Danmarks gamle Folkeviser, <span class="smcap">IV</span>, 24,
note.**</p>

<p>Another Transylvanian tale, Schuster, p. 433, has a fountain, a thirsty
bride, and doves (two or three) that sing to her, traits which have
perhaps been derived from some Ulinger ballad; but the fountain is
of an entirely different character, and the doves serve a different
purpose. The tale is a variety of 'Fitchers Vogel,' Grimms, No 46,
and belongs to the class of stories to which 'Bluebeard,' from its
extensive popularity, has given name. The magician of 'Fitcher's
Vogel' and of 'Bluebeard' becomes, or remains, a preternatural being
(a hill-man) further north, as in Grundtvig's Gamle danske Minder,
1857, No 312, p. 182. There is a manifest affinity between these
three species of tales and our ballad (also between the German and
Danish tales and the Scandinavian ballad of 'Rosmer'), but the precise
nature of this affinity it is impossible to expound. 'Bluebeard,' 'La
Barbe Bleue,' Perrault, Histoires ou Contes du temps passé, 1697, p.
57 (Lefèvre), has a special resemblance to the German ballads of the
second class in the four calls to sister Anne, which represent the
cries to father, mother, and brother, and agrees with these ballads as
to the means by which the death of the malefactor is brought about.</p>

<p>Looking back now over the whole field covered by this ballad, we
observe that the framework of the story is essentially the same in
English, Dutch, Danish, Swedish, Norwegian; in the first class of
the German ballads; in Polish <b>A</b>; in French, Italian, Spanish,
Portuguese, and Magyar. The woman delivers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-48" id="Pg_1-48">[Pg 48]</a></span> herself from death by
some artifice,<a name="FNanchor_1_72" id="FNanchor_1_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> and retaliates upon the man the destruction he had
intended for her. The second form of the German ballad attributes the
deliverance of the woman to her brother, and also the punishment of the
murderer. The third form of the German ballad makes the woman lose her
life, and her murderer, for the most part, to suffer the penalty of the
law, though in some cases the brother takes immediate vengeance. Polish
<b>B-K</b> may be ranked with the second German class, and <b>O-CC</b>
still better with the third; but the brother appears in only a few
of these, and, when he appears, counts for nothing. The Wendish and
the Bohemian ballad have the incident of fraternal vengeance, though
otherwise less like the German. The Servian ballad, a slight thing at
best, is still less like, but ranks with the third German class. The
oldest Icelandic copy is altogether anomalous, and also incomplete, but
seems to imply the death of the woman: later copies suffer the woman to
escape, without vengeance upon the murderer.</p>

<p>It is quite beyond question that the third class of German ballad
is a derivation from the second.<a name="FNanchor_1_73" id="FNanchor_1_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> Of the versions <b>T-Z</b>,
<b>Z</b> alone has preserved clear traits of the marvellous. A king's
daughter is enticed from home by Ulrich's singing, and is warned of
her impending fate by the dove, as in Class II. The other ballads have
the usual marks of degeneracy, a dropping or obscuring of marvellous
and romantic incidents, and a declension in the rank and style of
the characters. <b>T</b>, to be sure, has a hazel, and <b>Y</b> a
tree-stump and a spring, and in <b>T</b> Ulrich offers to teach Ännchen
bird-song, but these traits have lost all significance. Knight and lady
sink to ordinary man and maid; for though in <b>Y</b> the woman is
called a king's daughter, the opening stanzas of <b>Y</b> are borrowed
from a different ballad. Ulrich retains so much of the knight that
he rides to Ännchen's house, in the first stanza of <b>T</b>, but he
apparently goes on foot with her to the wood, and this is the rule in
all the other ballads of this class. As Ulrich has lost his horse, so
the brother, in <b>T</b>, <b>U</b>, <b>V</b>, <b>X</b>, has lost his
sword, or the use of it, and in all these (also, superfluously, in
<b>W</b>) Ulrich, like a common felon as he was, is broken on the wheel.</p>

<p>That the woman should save her life by her own craft and courage is
certainly a more primitive conception than that she should depend
upon her brother, and the priority of this arrangement of the plot
is supported, if not independently proved, by the concurrence, as
to this point, of so many copies among so many nations, as also by
the accordance of various popular tales. The second German form must
therefore, so far forth, be regarded as a modification of the first.
Among the several devices, again, which the woman employs in order
to get the murderer into her power, the original would seem to be
her inducing him to lay his head in her lap, which gives her the
opportunity (by the use of charms or runes, in English <b>A</b>, Danish
<b>G</b>, Norwegian <b>F</b>, <b>H</b>, and one form of <b>B</b>) to
put him into a deep sleep. The success of this trick no doubt implies
considerable simplicity on the part of the victim of it; not more,
however, than is elsewhere witnessed in preternatural beings, whose
wits are frequently represented as no match for human shrewdness. Some
of the Scandinavian ballads are not liable to the full force of this
objection, whatever that may be, for they make the knight express a
suspicion of treachery, and the lady solemnly asseverate that she will
not kill [fool, beguile] him in his sleep. And so, when he is fast
bound, she cries out, Wake up, for I will not kill thee <i>in thy sleep</i>!
This last circumstance is wanting in hardly any of the Scandinavian
ballads, whereas the previous compact is found only in Danish <b>E</b>,
<b>F</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>L</b>, Swedish <b>A</b>, Norwegian
<b>A</b>, and the Icelandic ballad. Not occurring in any of the older
Danish copies, it may be that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-49" id="Pg_1-49">[Pg 49]</a></span> the compact is an after-thought, and
was inserted to qualify the improbability. But the lady's equivocation
is quite of a piece with Memering's oath in 'Ravengaard and Memering,'
Grundtvig, No 13, and King Dietrich's in the Dietrichsaga, Unger, c.
222, p. 206.<a name="FNanchor_1_74" id="FNanchor_1_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>English <b>A</b> and all the Danish, Swedish, and Norwegian ballads
employ the stratagem of lulling the man to sleep, but these are not the
only ballads in which the man lays his head in the woman's lap. This
trait is observed in nearly all German ballads of the second and third
class, in <i>all</i> the well-preserved ones, and also in the Magyar ballad.
With regard to the German ballads, however, it is purposeless (for it
does not advance the action of the drama in the least), and must be
regarded as a relic of an earlier form.<a name="FNanchor_1_75" id="FNanchor_1_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> English <b>B-F</b> and all
the French ballads dispose of the traitor by a watery death. The scene
is shifted from a wood to a sea-coast, pool, or river bank, perhaps
to suit the locality to which the ballad had wandered. In English
<b>B</b>, where, apparently under the influence of other ballads,<a name="FNanchor_1_76" id="FNanchor_1_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
the lady is forced to wade into water up to her chin, the knight is
pushed off his horse when bending over to give a last kiss for which he
had been asked; in English <b>C-F</b> and French <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>,
the man is induced to turn his face to save the woman's modesty; in
French <b>C-E</b> he is made to pull off her stockings or shoes, and
then, while off his guard, pitched into a sea or river. This expedient
is sufficiently trivial; but still more so, and grazing on the
farcical, is that which is made use of in the Dutch ballad and those of
the German first class, the woman's persuading the man to take off his
fine coat lest it should be spattered with her blood, and cutting off
his head with his own sword while he is thus occupied. The Spanish and
Portuguese ballads make the lady borrow the knight's knife to remove
some of the trimming of her dress, and in the Italian she borrows his
sword to cut a bough to shade her horse; for in Italian the halt in the
wood is completely forgotten, and the last half of the action takes
place on horseback. All these contrivances plainly have less claim to
be regarded as primary than that of binding the murderer after he has
been put to sleep.</p>

<p>The knight in English <b>A</b> is called an Elf, and as such is
furnished with an enchanting horn, which is replaced by a harp of
similar properties in <b>B</b>, where, however, the male personage
has neither name nor any kind of designation. The elf-horn of English
<b>A</b> is again represented by the seductive song of the Dutch
ballad and of German <b>G-R</b> and <b>Z</b>. Though the lady is not
lured away in the Scandinavian ballads by irresistible music,<a name="FNanchor_1_77" id="FNanchor_1_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
Danish <b>A</b>, <b>E</b>, Norwegian <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, and Swedish
<b>D</b> present to her the prospect of being taken to an elf-land, or
elysium, and there are traces of this in Danish <b>G</b> and <b>D</b>
also, and in Polish <b>Q</b>. The tongue that talks after the head is
off, in the Dutch ballad and in German <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>,
<b>E</b>, is another mark of an unearthly being. Halewyn, Ulver, Gert
Olbert, like the English knight, are clearly supernatural, though of a
nondescript type. The elf in English <b>A</b> is not to be interpreted
too strictly, for the specific elf is not of a sanguinary turn, as
these so conspicuously are. He is comparatively innocuous, like the
hill-man Young Akin, in another English ballad, who likewise entices
away a woman by magical music, but only to make her his wife. But the
elf-knight and the rest seem to delight in bloodshed for its own sake;
for, as Grundtvig has pointed out, there is no other apparent motive
for murder in English <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, the Norwegian ballads, Danish
<b>A</b>, Swedish <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, or German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-50" id="Pg_1-50">[Pg 50]</a></span> <b>A-E</b>.<a name="FNanchor_1_78" id="FNanchor_1_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> This
is true again, for one reason or another, of others of the German
ballads, of the French, of most of the Italian, and of the Hungarian
ballads.</p>

<p>The nearest approach to the Elf-knight, Halewyn, etc., is perhaps
Quintalin, in the saga of Samson the Fair. He was son of the miller
Galin. Nobody knew who his mother was, but many were of the mind that
Galin might have had him of a "goddess," an elf or troll woman, who
lived under the mill force. He was a thief, and lay in the woods;
was versed in many knave's tricks, and had also acquired agreeable
arts. He was a great master of the harp, and would decoy women into
the woods with his playing, keep them as long as he liked, and send
them home pregnant to their fathers or husbands. A king's daughter,
Valentina, is drawn on by his music deep into the woods, but is rescued
by a friendly power. Some parts of her dress and ornaments, which she
had laid off in her rapid following up of the harping, are afterwards
found, with a great quantity of precious things, in the subaqueous cave
of Quintalin's mother, who is a complete counterpart to Grendel's, and
was probably borrowed from Beówulf.<a name="FNanchor_1_79" id="FNanchor_1_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> This demi-elf Quintalin is
a tame personage by the side of Grendel or of Halewyn. Halewyn does
not devour his victims, like Grendel: Quintalin does not even murder
his. He allures women with his music to make them serve his lust. We
may infer that he would plunder them, for he is a notorious thief.
Even two of the oldest Danish ballads, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, and again
Danish <b>I</b> and Swedish <b>C</b>, make the treacherous knight as
lecherous as bloody, and so with German <b>J</b>, <b>K</b>, <b>L</b>,
<b>O</b>, <b>P</b>, <b>Q</b>, <b>R</b>, <b>S</b>, and Italian <b>A</b>,
<b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>. This trait is wanting in Danish
<b>D</b>, where, though traces of the originally demonic nature of
the knight remain, the muckle gold of the maids already appears as
the motive for the murders. In the later Danish <b>E-H</b>, <b>K</b>,
<b>L</b>, and Swedish <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, the original elf or demon
has sunk to a remorseless robber, generally with brothers, sisters, or
underlings for accomplices.<a name="FNanchor_1_80" id="FNanchor_1_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> This is preëminently his character in
English <b>C-F</b>, in nearly all the forty Polish ballads, and in the
two principal ballads of the German second class, <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>,
though English <b>D</b>, German <b>H</b>, and Polish <b>Q</b> retain
a trace of the supernatural: the first in the charm by means of which
the knight compels the maid to quit her parents, the second in the
bloody spring, and the last in the golden mountains. There is nothing
that unequivocally marks the robber in the other German ballads of the
second class and in those of the third. The question 'Weinst du um
deines Vaters Gut?' in <b>I-L</b>, <b>O-S</b>, <b>T-W</b>, is hardly
decisive, and only in <b>W</b> and <b>Z</b> is it expressly said that
the maid had taken valuable things with her (as in Swedish <b>D</b>,
Norwegian <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, English <b>D-F</b>). <b>J-L</b>,
<b>O-S</b>, give us to understand that the lady had lost her honor,<a name="FNanchor_1_81" id="FNanchor_1_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
but in all the rest, except the anomalous <b>Z</b>, the motive for
murder is insufficient.<a name="FNanchor_1_82" id="FNanchor_1_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>The woman in these ballads is for the most part nameless, or bears a
stock name to which no importance can be attached. Not so with the
names of the knight. Most of these are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-51" id="Pg_1-51">[Pg 51]</a></span> peculiar, and the Northern
ones, though superficially of some variety, have yet likeness enough to
tempt one to seek for a common original. Grundtvig, with considerable
diffidence, suggests Oldemor as a possible ground-form. He conceives
that the <b>R</b> of some of the Scandinavian names may be a relic of
a foregoing Herr. The initial <b>H</b> would easily come or go. Given
such a name as Hollemen (Danish <b>C</b>), we might expect it to give
place to Halewyn, which is both a family and a local name in Flanders,
if the ballad should pass into the Low Countries from Denmark, a
derivation that Grundtvig is far from asserting. So Ulinger, a local
appellation, might be substituted for the Ulver of Danish <b>A</b>.
Grundtvig, it must be borne in mind, declines to be responsible for
the historical correctness of this genealogy, and would be still less
willing to undertake an explanation of the name Oldemor.</p>

<p>In place of Oldemor, Professor Sophus Bugge, in a recent article,
marked by his characteristic sharp-sightedness and ingenuity, has
proposed Hollevern, Holevern, or Olevern as the base-form of all the
Northern names for the bloody knight, and he finds in this name a main
support for the entirely novel and somewhat startling hypothesis that
the ballad we are dealing with is a wild shoot from the story of Judith
and Holofernes.<a name="FNanchor_1_83" id="FNanchor_1_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> His argument, given as briefly as possible, is as
follows.</p>

<p>That the Bible story was generally known in the Middle Ages no one
would question. It was treated in a literary way by an Anglo-Saxon
poet, who was acquainted with the scriptural narrative, and in
a popular way by poets who had no direct acquaintance with the
original.<a name="FNanchor_1_84" id="FNanchor_1_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> The source of the story in the ballad must in any case
be a tradition many times removed from the biblical story; that much
should be changed, much dropped, and much added is only what would be
expected.</p>

<p>Beginning the comparison with 'Judith' with this caution, it is first
submitted that Holofernes can be recognized in most of the Scandinavian
and German names of the knight. The v of the proposed base-form is
preserved in Ulver, Halewyn, and probably in the English Elf-knight. It
is easy to explain a v's passing over to g, as in Ulinger, Adelger, and
especially under the influence of the very common names in -ger. Again,
v might easily become b, as in Olbert, or m, as in Hollemen, Olmor; and
the initial R of Rulleman, Romor, etc., may have been carried over from
a prefixed Herr.<a name="FNanchor_1_85" id="FNanchor_1_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>The original name of the heroine has been lost, and yet it is to be
noticed that Gert Olbert's mother, in German <b>A</b>, is called Fru
Jutte.</p>

<p>The heroine in this same ballad is named Helena (Linnich in <b>F</b>);
in others (German <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>), Odilia. These are
names of saints, and this circumstance may tend to show that the woman
in the ballad was originally conceived of as rather a saint than a
secular character, though in the course of time the story has so
changed that the devout widow who sought out her country's enemy in his
own camp has been transformed into a young maid who is enticed from
home by a treacherous suitor.</p>

<p>It is an original trait in the ballad that the murderer, as is
expressly said in many copies, is from a foreign land. According to
an English version (<b>E</b>), he comes from the north, as Holofernes
does, "venit Assur ex montibus ab aquilone" (Jud. xvi, 5).</p>

<p>The germ of this outlandish knight's blood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-52" id="Pg_1-52">[Pg 52]</a></span>thirstiness is found in
the truculent part that Holofernes plays in the Bible, his threats
and devastations. That the false suitor appears without companions is
in keeping with the ballad style of representation; yet we might find
suggestions of the Assyrian's army in the swains, the brothers, the
stable-boy, whom the maid falls in with on her way home.</p>

<p>The splendid promises made in many of the ballads might have been
developed from the passage where Holofernes, whose bed is described as
wrought with purple, gold, and precious stones, says to Judith, Thou
shalt be great in the house of Nebuchadnezzar, and thy name shall be
named in all the earth (xi, 21).</p>

<p>In many forms of the ballad, especially the Dutch and the German, the
maid adorns herself splendidly, as Judith does: she even wears some
sort of crown in Dutch <b>A</b> 16, German <b>D</b> 8, as Judith does
in x, 3, xvi, 10 (mitram).</p>

<p>In the English <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, the oldest Danish,
<b>A</b>, and the Polish versions, the maid, like Judith, leaves her
home in the night.</p>

<p>The Piedmontese casté, Italian <b>E</b> 1 [there is a castle in nearly
all the Italian ballads, and also in Dutch <b>B</b>], may remind us of
Holofernes' castra.</p>

<p>The knight's carrying off the maid, lifting her on to his horse in many
copies, may well come from a misunderstanding of elevaverunt in Judith
x, 20: Et cum in faciem ejus intendisset, adoravit eum, prosternens
se super terram. Et elevaverunt eam servi Holofernis, jubente domino
suo.<a name="FNanchor_1_86" id="FNanchor_1_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>In German <b>A</b> Gert Olbert and Helena are said to ride three days
and nights, and in Danish <b>D</b> the ride is for three days; and we
may remember that Judith killed Holofernes the fourth day after her
arrival in his camp.</p>

<p>The place in which the pair alight is, according to German <b>G</b> 20,
a deep dale, and this agrees with the site of Holofernes' camp in the
valley of Bethulia. There is a spring or stream in many of the ballads,
and also a spring in the camp, in which Judith bathes (xii, 7).</p>

<p>Most forms of the ballad make the knight, after the halt, inform the
maid that she is to die, as many maids have before her in the same
place; e.g., German <b>G</b> 7:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Der Ulinger hat eylff Jungfrawen gehangen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Die zwölfft hat er gefangen.'<a name="FNanchor_1_87" id="FNanchor_1_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This corresponds with the passage in Judith's song (xvi, 6), <em class="gesperrt">Dixit
se</em> ... infantes meos <em class="gesperrt">dare</em> in prædam et <em class="gesperrt">virgenes in
captivitatem</em>: but it is reasonable to suppose that the ballad
follows some version of the Bible words that varied much from the
original.</p>

<p>The incident of the maid's lousing and tousing her betrayer's hair,
while he lies with his head in her lap, may have come from Judith
seizing Holofernes by the hair before she kills him, but the story of
Samson and Delilah may have had influence here.</p>

<p>According to many German versions, the murderer grants the maid three
cries before she dies. She invokes Jesus, Mary, and her brother. Or she
utters three sighs, the first to God the Father, the second to Jesus,
the third to her brother. These cries or sighs seem to take the place
of Judith's prayer, Confirma me, Domine Deus Israel (xiii, 7), and it
may also be well to remember that Holofernes granted Judith, on her
request, permission to go out in the night to pray.</p>

<p>The Dutch, Low-German, Scandinavian, and other versions agree in making
the woman kill the knight with his own sword, as in Judith. The Dutch
and Low-German [also Danish <b>F</b>, Swedish <b>A</b>] have preserved
an original trait in making the maid hew off the murderer's head.
English and French versions dispose of the knight differently: the maid
pushes him into sea or river. Perhaps, in some older form of the story,
after the head was cut off, the <i>trunk</i> was pushed into the water:
cf. Judith xiii, 10: Abscidit caput ejus et ... evolvit corpus ejus
truncum. The words apprehendit comam capitis ejus (xiii, 9) have their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-53" id="Pg_1-53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
parallel in Dutch <b>A</b>, 33: "Zy nam het hoofd al by het haer." The
Dutch ballad makes the maid carry the head with her.</p>

<p>"Singing and ringing" she rode through the wood: Judith sings a song of
praise to the Lord after her return home.</p>

<p>In English <b>C-F</b>, May Colven comes home before dawn, as Judith
does. The Dutch <b>A</b> says, When to her father's gate she came, she
blew the horn like a man. Compare Judith xiii, 13: Et dixit Judith a
longe custodibus murorum, Aperite portas!</p>

<p>The Dutch text goes on to say that when the father heard the horn he
was delighted at his daughter's return: and Judith v, 14, Et factum
est, cum audissent viri vocem ejus, vocaverunt presbyteros civitatis.</p>

<p>The conclusion of Dutch <b>A</b> is that there was a banquet held, and
the head was set on the table. So Judith causes Holofernes' head to be
hung up on the city wall, and after the enemy have been driven off, the
Jews hold a feast.</p>

<p>The Icelandic version, though elsewhere much mutilated, has a
concluding stanza which certainly belongs to the ballad:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ása went into a holy cell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never did she harm to man.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This agrees with the view taken of the heroine of the ballad as a
saint, and with the Bible account that Judith lived a chaste widow
after her husband's demise.</p>

<p>Danish <b>D</b> is unique in one point. The robber has shown the maid
a little knoll, in which the "much gold" of the women he has murdered
lies. When she has killed him, the maid says, "<i>I</i> shall have the
much gold," and takes as much as she can carry off. Compare with this
Holofernes putting Judith into his treasury (xii, 1),<a name="FNanchor_1_88" id="FNanchor_1_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> her carrying
off the conop&#339;um (xiii, 10), and her receiving from the people
all Holofernes' gold, silver, clothes, jewels, and furniture, as her
share of the plunder of the Assyrian camp (xv, 14). It is, perhaps, a
perversion of this circumstance that the robber in German <b>G</b>,
<b>H</b>, is refused permission to keep his costly clothes.</p>

<p>English <b>D</b> seems also to have preserved a portion of the
primitive story, when it makes the maid tell her parents in the morning
all that has happened, whereupon they go with her to the sea-shore to
find the robber's body. The foundation for this is surely the Bible
account that Judith makes known her act to the elders of the city,
and that the Jews go out in the morning and fall on the enemy's camp,
in which Holofernes' body is lying. In Swedish <b>C</b> the robber's
sisters mourn over his body, and in Judith xiv, 18 the Assyrians break
out into loud cries when they learn of Holofernes' death.</p>

<p>In all this it is simply contended that the story of Judith is the
remote source of the ballad, and it is conceded that many of the
correspondences which have been cited may be accidental. Neither the
Latin text of Judith nor any other written treatment of the story of
Judith is supposed to have been known to the author of the ballad. The
knowledge of its biblical origin being lost, the story would develop
itself in its own way, according to the fashion of oral tradition.
And so the pious widow into whose hands God gave over his enemies is
converted into a fair maid who is enticed by a false knight into a
wood, and who kills him in defence of her own life.</p>

<p>A similar transformation can be shown elsewhere in popular poetry.
The little Katie of certain northern ballads (see Grundtvig, No 101)
is a maid among other maids who prefers death to dishonor; but was
originally Saint Catherine, daughter of the king of Egypt, who suffered
martyrdom for the faith under the Emperor Maxentius. All the versions
of the Halewyn ballad which we possess, even the purest, may be far
removed from the primitive, both as to story and as to metrical form.
New features would be taken up, and old ones would disappear. One copy
has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-54" id="Pg_1-54">[Pg 54]</a></span> preserved genuine particulars, which another has lost, but Dutch
tradition has kept the capital features best of all.<a name="FNanchor_1_89" id="FNanchor_1_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>Professor Bugge's argument has been given with an approach to fulness
out of a desire to do entire justice to the distinguished author's
case, though most of the correspondences adduced by him fail to produce
any effect upon my mind.</p>

<p>The case is materially strengthened by the Dutch text <b>C</b>
('Roland'), which was not accessible at the time Bugge's paper was
written. The name Roland is not so close to Holofern as Halewyn, but
is still within the range of conceivable metamorphosis. The points of
coincidence between Dutch <b>C</b> and the story of Judith are these:
The woman, first making an elaborate toilet,<a name="FNanchor_1_90" id="FNanchor_1_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> goes out to seek the
man, who is spoken of as surrounded with soldiers; she is challenged
on the way; finds Roland lying on his bed, which he proposes she shall
share (or lose her life);<a name="FNanchor_1_91" id="FNanchor_1_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> she cuts off his head, which, after her
return home, she exposes from her window.<a name="FNanchor_1_92" id="FNanchor_1_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>If this was the original form of the Dutch ballad, and the Dutch ballad
is the source from which all the other ballads have come, by processes
of dropping, taking up, and transforming, then we may feel compelled to
admit that this ballad might be a wild shoot from the story of Judith.
Any one who bears in mind the strange changes which stories undergo
will hesitate to pronounce this impossible. What poor Ophelia says of
us human creatures is even truer of ballads: "We know what we are, but
know not what we may be."</p>

<p>But when we consider how much would have to be dropped, how much
to be taken up, and how much to be transformed, before the Hebrew
"gest" could be converted into the European ballad, we naturally look
for a less difficult hypothesis. It is a supposition attended with
less difficulty that an independent European tradition existed of a
half-human, half-demonic being, who possessed an irresistible power of
decoying away young maids, and was wont to kill them after he got them
into his hands, but who at last found one who was more than his match,
and lost his own life through her craft and courage. A modification
of this story is afforded by the large class of Bluebeard tales. The
Quintalin story seems to be another variety, with a substitution of
lust for bloodthirst. The Dutch ballad may have been <i>affected</i> by some
lost ballad of Holofern, and may have taken up some of its features, at
least that of carrying home Halewyn's [Roland's] head, which is found
in no other version.<a name="FNanchor_1_93" id="FNanchor_1_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

perhaps has borrowed its opening stanzas from this ballad. See page 13.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_26" id="Footnote_1_26"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_26"><span class="label">[26]</span></a> Perhaps the change from wood, <b>A</b>, to water,
<b>B-F</b>, was made under the influence of some Merman ballad, or
by admixture with such a ballad; e.g., 'Nøkkens Svig,' Grundtvig, No
39. In this (<b>A</b>) the nix entices a king's daughter away from a
dance, sets her on his horse, and rides with her over the heath to a
wild water, into which she sinks. It is also quite among possibilities
that there was originally an English nix ballad, in which the king's
daughter saved herself by some artifice, not, of course, such as is
employed in <b>B-F</b>, but like that in <b>A</b>, or otherwise. Maid
Heiemo, in Landstad, No 39, kills a nix with "one of her small knives."
Had she put him to sleep with a charm, and killed him with <i>his own</i>
knife, as Lady Isabel does, there would have been nothing to shock
credibility in the story.
</p>
<p>
Aytoun, Ballads of Scotland, <span class="smcap">I</span>, 219, 2d ed., hastily
pronounces Buchan's ballad not authentic, "being made up of stanzas
borrowed from versions of 'Burd Helen' ['Child Waters']." There
are, indeed, three successive steps into the water in both ballads,
but Aytoun should have bethought himself how natural and how common
it is for a passage to slip from one ballad into another, when the
circumstances of the story are the same; and in some such cases no
one can say where the verses that are common originally belonged.
Here, indeed, as Grundtvig remarks, <span class="smcap">IV</span>, 7, note*, it may well
be that the verses in question belonged originally to 'Burd Helen,'
and were adopted (but in the processes of tradition) into 'The Water
of Wearie's Well;' for it must be admitted that the transaction in
the water is not a happy conception in the latter, since it shocks
probability that the woman should be able to swim ashore, and the man
not.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_1_27" id="Footnote_1_27"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_27"><span class="label">[27]</span></a> "This ballad appears modern, from a great many
expressions, but yet I am certain that it is old: the present copy came
from the housekeeper at Methven." Note by Sharpe, in Laing's ed. of the
Ballad Book, 1880, p. 130, xvii. Motherwell, in his Minstrelsy, p. lxx,
n. 24, says that he had seen a stall ballad as early as 1749, entitled
'The Western Tragedy,' which perfectly agreed with Sharpe's copy. But
in his Note-Book, p. 5 (about 1826-7), Motherwell says, "The best copy
of May Colean with which I have met occurs in a stall copy printed
about thirty years ago [should we then read 1799 instead of 1749?],
under the title of 'The Western Tragedy.' I have subsequently seen a
posterior reprint of this stall copy under this title, 'The Historical
Ballad of May Collean.' In Mr. Sharpe's Ballad Book, the same copy,
wanting only one stanza, is given."</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_1_28" id="Footnote_1_28"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_28"><span class="label">[28]</span></a> According to the variation given by Willems, and adopted
by Hoffmann, Halewijn's <i>son</i> came to meet her, tied her horse to a
tree, and bade her to sit down by him and loose her hair. For every
hair she undid she dropped a tear. But it will presently be seen
not only that the time has not come for them to sit down, but that
Halewijn's bidding her undo her hair (to no purpose) is a perversion of
her offering to "red" <i>his</i>, to get him into her power, an offer which
she makes in the German and Scandinavian ballads, where also there is
good reason for her tears, but none as yet here.</p></div>

<p>
Halewyn makes his appearance again in the Flemish ballad, 'Halewyn en
het kleyne Kind,' Coussemaker, No 46, p. 149; Poésies populaires de la
France, vol. <span class="smcap">I</span>. A boy of seven years has shot one of Halewyn's
rabbits, and is for this condemned to be hanged on the highest tree in
the park. The father makes great offers for his ransom, but in vain.
On the first step of the ladder the child looks back for his mother,
on the second for his father, on the third for his brother, on the
fourth for his sister, each of whom successively arrives and is told
that delay would have cost him his life. It will presently be seen that
there is a resemblance here to German ballads (<b>G-X</b>, <b>Z</b>).</p></div>

le peuple l'a conservée; on serait sans aucun doute en possession de

Stolz Syburg is the hero of a very different ballad, from the Münster
region, Reifferscheid, No 16, p. 32 (also No 17, and Simrock, No 9,
p. 23, 'Stolz Heinrich'). And from this the name, in consequence of a
remote resemblance in the story, may have been taken up by the Rhine
ballad, though it has contributed nothing more. Margaret, a king's
daughter, is wiled away by a splendid description of Stolz Syburg's
opulence. When they have gone a long way, he tells her that he has
nothing but a barren heath. She stabs herself at his feet.</p></div>

through woods and forests, weeping her eyes out on the way. Kind souls
dug a grave for her. The conclusion of <b>M</b> is absurd, but need not
be particularized. <b>G</b> has a passage of the sternest theology.
While Catherine is struggling in the water, her father comes by. She
cries to him to save her. He says, "My dear Catherine, you have loved
pleasure too much. Lord Jesus grant you drown!" Her mother appears, and
makes the same reply to her daughter's appeal. There are stall-copy
terminal morals to many of the ballads.</p></div>

of nothing but the hilt being above ground, which was accepted as
satisfactory. Presently he pulls Adelring out of the ground, into which
he had thrust the blade, and, being accused of perjury, triumphantly
rejoins that he had sworn that he knew of nothing but the hilt <i>being

<p><a name="Footnote_1_82" id="Footnote_1_82"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_82"><span class="label">[82]</span></a> It is well known that in the Middle Ages the blood of
children or of virgins was reputed a specific for leprosy (see, e.g.,
Cassel in the Weimar Jahrbücher, <span class="smcap">I</span>, 408.) Some have thought to
find in this fact an explanation of the murders in these ballads and
in the Bluebeard stories, and, according to Rochholz, this theory has
been adopted into popular tradition in the Aargau. So far as this cycle
of ballads is concerned, there is as much ground for holding that the
blood was wanted to cure leprosy as for believing that the gold was
wanted for <i>aurum potabile</i>.</p></div>

not the slightest need of Holefern to <i>account</i> for Halewyn. Halewyn,
besides being a well-known local and family appellation, is found in
two other Dutch ballads, one of which (Lootens and Feys, p. 66, No 38;
Hoffmann, p. 46, No 11) has no kind of connection with the present,
and is no more likely to have derived the name from this than this
from that. It shall not be denied that Adelger, Hilsinger, Rullemann,
Reimvord might have sprung from or have been suggested by Holofern,
under the influence of familiar terminations, but it may be remarked
that Hildebrand, Ravengaard, Valdemar, Rosmer, if they had occurred in
any version, would have occasioned no greater difficulty.</p></div>

Scandinavians from the Germans, more precisely by the Danes from a Low
German form. This, he says, would follow from what he has maintained
above, and he finds support for his view in many particular traits
of Norse copies. Thus, one of the Norwegian names for the murderer
is Alemarken. The first three syllables are very near to the Danish
Oldemor; but -ken seems to be the German diminutive suffix, and can
only be explained by the ballad having come from Germany.</p></div>

<p>Eight copies of this ballad are extant, four of them hitherto
unpublished. <b>A a</b>, No 16 in the Jamieson-Brown MS., is one of
twenty ballads written down from the recitation of Mrs. Brown of
Falkland, by her nephew, Robert Scott, in 1783, or shortly before. From
these twenty thirteen were selected, and, having first been revised
by Mrs. Brown, were sent, with two others, to William Tytler in the
year just mentioned. William Tytler's MS. has disappeared, but a list
of the ballads which it contained, with the first stanza of each,
is given by Dr Anderson, in Nichols's Illustrations of the Literary
History of the Eighteenth Century, <span class="smcap">VII</span>, 176. <b>B</b> is the
'Cospatrick' of the Border Minstrelsy, described by Scott as taken down
from the recitation of a lady (known to be Miss Christian Rutherford,
his mother's sister) "with some stanzas transferred from Herd's copy,
and some readings adopted from a copy in Mrs Brown's manuscript under
the title of Child Brenton," that is, from <b>A b</b>. <b>C</b>
purports to be one of a considerable number of pieces, "copied from
the recital of a peasant-woman of Galloway, upwards of ninety years
of age." Though overlaid with verses of Cunningham's making (of which
forty or fifty may be excided in one mass) and though retouched almost
everywhere, both the groundwork of the story and some genuine lines
remain unimpaired. The omission of most of the passage referred to,
and the restoration of the stanza form, will give us, perhaps, a thing
of shreds and patches, but still a ballad as near to genuine as some
in Percy's Reliques or even Scott's Minstrelsy. <b>D</b> and <b>F</b>
are (the former presumably, the second certainly) from recitation of
the first quarter of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-63" id="Pg_1-63">[Pg 63]</a></span> century. <b>E</b> is one of the few ballads
in Elizabeth Cochrane's song-book, and probably of the first half of
the last century. <b>G</b>, the earliest printed form of the ballad,
appeared in Herd's first collection, in the year 1769. <b>H</b> was
taken down from recitation by the late Dr Hill Burton in his youth.</p>

<p><b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, and <b>C</b> agree in these points: A bride, not
being a maid, looks forward with alarm to her wedding night, and
induces her bower-woman to take her place for the nonce. The imposture
is detected by the bridegroom, through the agency of magical blankets,
sheets, and pillows, <b>A</b>; or of blankets, bed, sheet, and
sword, <b>B</b>; or simply of the Billie Blin, <b>C</b>. (The sword
is probably an editorial insertion; and Jamieson, Illustrations of
Northern Antiquities, p. 343, doubts, but without sufficient reason,
the Billie Blin.) The bridegroom has recourse to his mother, who
demands an explanation of the bride, and elicits a confession that she
had once upon a time encountered a young man in a wood, who subjected
her to violence. Before they parted, he gave her certain tokens, which
he enjoined her to be very careful of, a lock of his hair, a string
of beads, a gold ring, and a knife. <b>B</b> omits the knife, and
<b>C</b> the beads. The mother goes back to her son, and asks what he
had done with the tokens she had charged him never to part with. He
owns that he had presented them to a lady, one whom he would now give
all his possessions to have for his wife. The lady of the greenwood is
identified by the tokens.</p>

<p><b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, and <b>D</b> make the mother set a golden chair for
the bride, in which none but a maid can sit, <b>D</b> [no leal maid
will sit till bidden, <b>C</b>]. In <b>D</b> the chair is declined; in
<b>C</b>, taken without bidding; in <b>A</b> the significance of the
chair has been lost. <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>G</b> employ no kind of
test of maidenhood,&mdash;the bride frankly avows that she is with child to
another man; and <b>D</b>, as well as <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>,
omits the substitution of the chambermaid. The tokens in <b>D</b> are a
chain, a ring, and three locks of hair; in <b>E</b>, gloves and a ring;
in <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>, green gloves, a ring, and three locks [plaits]
of hair. Only the ring remains in <b>H</b>.</p>

<p>"This ballad," says Motherwell (1827), "is very popular, and is known
to reciters under a variety of names. I have heard it called Lord
Bangwell, Bengwill, Dingwall, Brengwill, etc., and The Seven Sisters,
or the Leaves of Lind." He adds: "There is an unedited ballad in
Scotland, which is a nearer approximation to the Danish song, inasmuch
as the substitution of the maiden sister for the real bride constitutes
a prominent feature of the tale."<a name="FNanchor_1_94" id="FNanchor_1_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> (Minstrelsy, Introduction,
lxix<sup>21</sup> and xc.)</p>

<p>Scott remarks that Cospatrick<a name="FNanchor_1_95" id="FNanchor_1_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> "was the designation of the Earl of
Dunbar, in the days of Wallace and Bruce." Mr Macmath informs me that
it is in use at the present day in the families of the Earl of Home and
of Dunbar of Mochrum, Bart, who, among others, claim descent from the
ancient earls of Dunbar and March. The story of the ballad might, of
course, attach itself to any person prominent in the region where the
ballad was known.</p>

<p><b>Swedish.</b> Three Swedish versions of this ballad were given by
Afzelius: <b>A</b>, 'Riddar Olle' in 50 two-line stanzas, <span class="smcap">II</span>,
217; <b>B</b>, 19 two-line stanzas, <span class="smcap">II</span>, 59; <b>C</b>, 19
two-line stanzas, <span class="smcap">II</span>, 56: No 33, <span class="smcap">I</span>, 175-182 of
Bergström's edition. Besides these, there are two fragments in
Cavallius and Stephens's unprinted collection: <b>D</b>, 6 stanzas;
<b>E</b>, 7 stanzas, the latter printed in Grundtvig, <span class="smcap">V</span>,
307.<a name="FNanchor_1_96" id="FNanchor_1_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-64" id="Pg_1-64">[Pg 64]</a></span> these were obtained from recitation in the present
century. <b>A</b> comes nearest to our <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>. Like
Scottish <b>B</b>, it seems to have been compounded from several
copies. Sir Olof betrothed Ingalilla, and carried her home for the
spousal, wearing a red gold crown and a wan cheek. Ingalilla gave birth
to twin-boys. Olof had a maid who resembled Ingalilla completely, and
who, upon Ingalilla's entreaty, consented to play the part of bride on
the morrow. Dressed in Ingalilla's clothes, blue kirtle, green jacket,
etc., and wearing five gold rings and a gold crown, the maid rode to
church, with Ingalilla at her back, and her beauty was admired by
all as she came and went. But outside of the church were a good many
musicians; and one of these piped out, "God-a-mercy, Ingalilla, no maid
art thou!" Ingalilla threw into the piper's hand something which made
him change his tune. He was an old drunken fellow, and no one need mind
what he sang. After five days of drinking, they took the bride to her
chamber, not without force. Ingalilla bore the light before her, and
helped put her to bed; then lay down herself. Olof had over him a fur
rug, which could talk as well as he, and it called out,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Hear me, Sir Olof, hear what I say;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou hast taken a strumpet, and missed a may.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And Olof,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Hear, little Inga, sweetheart,' he said;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'What didst thou get for thy maidenhead?'<a name="FNanchor_1_97" id="FNanchor_1_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Inga explained. Her father was a strange sort of man, and built her
bower by the sea-strand, where all the king's courtiers took ship. Nine
had broken in, and one had robbed her of her honor. He had given her an
embroidered sark, a blue kirtle, green jacket, black mantle, gloves,
five gold rings, a red gold crown, a golden harp, and a silver-mounted
knife, which she now wishes in the youngster's body. The conclusion is
abruptly told in two stanzas. Olof bids Inga not to talk so, for he is
father of her children. He embraces her and gives her a queen's crown
and name. <b>B</b> has the same story, omitting the incident of the
musician. <b>C</b> has preserved this circumstance, but has lost both
the substitution of the waiting-woman for the bride and the magical
coverlet. <b>D</b> has also lost these important features of the
original story; <b>E</b> has retained them.</p>

<p><b>Danish.</b> 'Brud ikke Mø,' Grundtvig, No 274, <span class="smcap">V</span>, 304.
There are two old versions (more properly only one, so close is the
agreement), and a third from recent tradition. This last, Grundtvig's
<b>C</b>, from Jutland, 1856, seems to be of Swedish origin, and, like
Swedish <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, wants the talking coverlet, though it has
kept the other material feature, that of the substitution. <b>A</b> is
found in two manuscripts, one of the sixteenth and the other of the
seventeenth century. <b>B</b> is the well-known 'Ingefred og Gudrune,'
or 'Herr Samsings Nattergale,' Syv, <span class="smcap">IV</span>, No 62, Danske Viser,
No 194, translated in Jamieson's Illustrations, p. 340, and by Prior,
<span class="smcap">III</span>, 347. A later form of <b>B</b>, from recent recitation,
1868, is given in Kristensen's Jydske Folkeviser, <span class="smcap">I</span>, No 53.</p>

<p>The story in <b>A</b> runs thus: Sølverlad and Vendelrod [Ingefred and
Gudrune] were sitting together, and Vendelrod wept sorely. Sølverlad
asked her sister the reason, and was told there was cause. Would she
be bride one night? Vendelrod would give her wedding clothes and all
her outfit. But Sølverlad asked for bridegroom too, and Vendelrod
would not give up her bridegroom, happen what might. She went to
church and was married to Samsing. On the way from church they met a
spaeman [<b>B</b>, shepherd], who warned Vendelrod that Samsing had
some nightingales that could tell him whether he had married a maid
or no. The sisters turned aside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-65" id="Pg_1-65">[Pg 65]</a></span> and changed clothes, but could not
change cheeks! Sølverlad was conducted to Samsing's house and placed
on the bride bench. An unlucky jester called out, "Methinks this is
not Vendelrod!" but a gold ring adroitly thrown into his bosom opened
his eyes still wider, and made him pretend he had meant nothing. The
supposed bride is put to bed. Samsing invokes his nightingales: "Have
I a maid or no?" They reply, it is a maid that lies in the bed, but
Vendelrod stands on the floor. Samsing asks Vendelrod why she avoided
her bed, and she answers: her father lived on the strand; her bower
was broken into by a large company of men, and one of them robbed her
of her honor. In this case there are no tokens for evidence. Samsing
owns immediately that he and his men had broken into the bower, and
Vendelrod's agony is over.</p>

<p>Some of the usual tokens, gold harp, sark, shoes, and silver-mounted
knife, are found in the later <b>C</b>. Danish <b>D</b> is but a single
initial stanza.</p>

<p>Besides Sølverlad and Vendelrod, there is a considerable number of
Danish ballads characterized by the feature that a bride is not a maid,
and most or all of these have similarities to 'Gil Brenton.' 'Hr.
Find og Vendelrod,' Grundtvig, No 275, has even the talking blanket
(sometimes misunderstood to be a bed-<i>board</i>). In this piece there is
no substitution. Vendelrod gives birth to children, and the news makes
Find jump over the table. Still he puts the question mildly, who is the
father, and recognizes that he is the man, upon hearing the story of
the bower on the strand, and seeing half a gold ring which Vendelrod
had received "for her honor."</p>

<p>In 'Ingelilles Bryllup,' Grundtvig, No 276, Blidelild is induced to
take Ingelild's place by the promise that she shall marry Ingelild's
brother. Hr. Magnus asks her why she is so sad, and says he knows she
is not a maid. Blidelild says, "Since you know so much, I will tell you
more," and relates Ingelild's adventure,&mdash;how she had gone out to the
river, and nine knights came riding by, etc. [so <b>A</b>; in <b>B</b>
and <b>C</b> we have the bower on the strand, as before]. Hr. Magnus
avows that he was the ninth, who stayed when eight rode away. Blidelild
begs that he will allow her to go and look for some lost rings, and
uses the opportunity to send back Ingelild in her stead.</p>

<p>Various other Scandinavian ballads have more or less of the story
of those which have been mentioned. In the Danish 'Brud i Vaande,'
Grundtvig, No 277, a bride is taken with untimely pains while being
"brought home." The question asked in several of the Scottish ballads,
whether the saddle is uncomfortable, occurs in <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>;
the bower that was forced by eight swains and a knight in <b>A</b>,
<b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>F</b>; the gifts in <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>,
<b>F</b>; and an express acknowledgment of the act of violence by the
bridegroom in <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>D</b>. We find all of these traits
except the first in the corresponding Swedish ballad 'Herr Äster och
Fröken Sissa,' Afzelius, No 38, new ed., No 32,<sup>1</sup>; the saddle and
broken bower in Swedish <b>D</b>, Grundtvig, No 277, Bilag 1; only the
saddle in Swedish <b>F</b>, Grundtvig, No. 277, Bilag 3, and <b>C</b>,
Arwidsson, No 132; the saddle and gifts in Icelandic <b>A</b>,
<b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, Grundtvig, No 277, Bilag 5, 6,
7, 8.</p>

<p>'Peder og Malfred,' Grundtvig, No 278, in four versions, the oldest
from a manuscript of 1630, represents Sir Peter as riding away from
home about a month after his marriage, and meeting a woman who informs
him that there is a birth in his house. He returns, and asks who is the
father. Sir Peter satisfies himself that he is the man by identifying
the gifts, in <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>; and in <b>A</b>,
<b>B</b> we have also the bower by the strand.</p>

<p>In 'Oluf og Ellinsborg,' Grundtvig, No 279, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>,
<b>C</b>, one of the queen's ladies is habitually sad, and is pressed
by her lover to account for this. She endeavors to put him off with
fictitious reasons, but finally nerves herself to tell the truth: she
was walking by herself in her orchard, when five knights came riding
by, and one was the cause of her grief. Oluf owns it was all his doing.
A Swedish ballad, remarkably close to the Danish, from a manuscript of
the date 1572 (the oldest Danish version is also from a manuscript of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-66" id="Pg_1-66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
the 16th century), is 'Riddar Lage och Stolts Elensborg,' Arwidsson, No
56.</p>

<p>'Iver Hr. Jonsøn,' Grundtvig, No 280, in five versions, the oldest of
the 16th century, exhibits a lady as fearing the arrival of her lover's
ship, and sending her mother to meet him, while she takes to her bed.
Immediately upon her betrothed's entering her chamber, she abruptly
discloses the cause of her trouble. Eight men had broken into her
bower on the strand, and the ninth deprived her of her honor. Iver Hr.
Jonsøn, with as little delay, confesses that he was the culprit, and
makes prompt arrangements for the wedding.</p>

<p>There is another series of ballads, represented by 'Leesome Brand' in
English, and by 'Redselille og Medelvold' in Danish, which describe a
young woman, who is on the point of becoming a mother, as compelled
to go off on horseback with her lover, and suffering from the ride.
We find the question, whether the saddle is too narrow or the way
too long, in the Danish 'Bolde Hr. Nilaus' Løn,' Grundtvig, 270,
'Redselille og Medelvold,' Grundtvig, 271 <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>,
<b>I</b>, <b>K</b>, <b>L</b>, <b>M</b>, <b>P</b>, <b>Q</b>, <b>V</b>,
<b>Y</b>, and the Norwegian versions, <b>A</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>,
<b>F</b>, of 'Sønnens Sorg,' Grundtvig, 272, Bilag 1, 4, 5, 6.<a name="FNanchor_1_98" id="FNanchor_1_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> The
gifts also occur in Grundtvig's 271 <b>A</b>, <b>Z</b>, and Norwegian
<b>D</b>, Bilag 9.</p>

<p>Perhaps no set of incidents is repeated so often in northern ballads
as the forcing of the bower on the strand, the giving of keepsakes,
the self-identification of the ravisher through these, and his full
and hearty reparation. All or some of these traits are found in
many ballads besides those belonging to the groups here spoken of:
as 'Hildebrand og Hilde,' <b>E</b>, <b>I</b>, Grundtvig, No 83, and
Norwegian <b>A</b>, <span class="smcap">III</span>, 857; 'Guldsmedens Datter,' Grundtvig,
245, and its Swedish counterpart at p. 481 of the preface to the same,
and in Eva Wigström's Folkdiktning, p. 37, No 18; 'Liden Kirstins
Dans,' Grundtvig, 263 (translated by Prior, 112), and Norwegian
<b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, Bilag 2, 3; 'Jomfruens Harpeslæt,' Grundtvig, 265
(translated by Jamieson, 'Illustrations,' p. 382, Prior, 123, Buchanan,
p. 6), and Swedish <b>D</b>, Bilag 2, Swedish <b>A</b>, Afzelius,
81. So Landstad, 42, 45; Arwidsson, 141; Grundtvig, 37 <b>G</b>; 38
<b>A</b>, <b>D</b>; Kristensen, <span class="smcap">I</span>, No 95, <span class="smcap">II</span>, No 28
<b>A</b>, <b>C</b>.</p>

<p>A very pretty Norwegian tale has for the talisman a stepping-stone at
the side of the bed: Asbjørnsen og Moe, No 29, 'Vesle Aase Gaasepige,'
Dasent, 2d ed., p. 478. An English prince had pictures taken of all
the handsomest princesses, to pick his bride by. When the chosen one
arrived, Aase the goose-girl informed her that the stone at the bedside
knew everything and told the prince; so if she felt uneasy on any
account, she must not step on it. The princess begged Aase to take her
place till the prince was fast asleep, and then they would change.
When Aase came and put her foot on the stone, the prince asked, "Who
is it that is stepping into my bed?" "A maid clean and pure," answered
the stone. By and by the princess came and took Aase's place. When
they were getting up in the morning, the prince asked again, "Who is
it stepping out of my bed?" "One that has had three children," said
the stone. The prince sent his first choice away, and tried a second.
Aase faithfully warned her, and she had cause for heeding the advice.
When Aase stepped in, the stone said it was a maid clean and pure;
when the princess stepped out, the stone said it was one that had had
six children. The prince was longer in hitting on a third choice. Aase
took the bride's place once more, but this time the prince put a ring
on her finger, which was so tight that she could not get it off, for
he saw that all was not right. In the morning, when he asked, "Who is
stepping out of my bed?" the stone answered, "One that has had nine
children." Then the prince asked the stone to clear up the mystery, and
it revealed how the princesses had put little Aase in their place. The
prince went straight to Aase to see if she had the ring. She had tied a
rag over her finger, pretending she had cut it; but the prince soon had
the rag off, recognized his ring, and Aase got the prince, for the good
reason that so it was to be.</p>

<p>The artifice of substituting waiting-woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-67" id="Pg_1-67">[Pg 67]</a></span> for bride has been
thought to be derived from the romance of Tristan, in which Brangwain
[Brengain, Brangaene] sacrifices herself for Isold: Scott's 'Sir
Tristrem,' ii, 54; Gottfried <span class="smcap">V</span>. Strassburg, xviii, ed.
Bechstein. Grundtvig truly remarks that a borrowing by the romance
from the popular ballad is as probable a supposition as the converse;
and that, even should we grant the name of the hero of the ballad
to be a reminiscence of that of Isold's attendant (e. g. Brangwill
of Brangwain), nothing follows as to the priority of the romance in
respect to this passage. A similar artifice is employed in the ballad
of 'Torkild Trundeson,' Danske Viser, 200 (translated by Prior,
100); Afzelius, <span class="smcap">II</span>, 86, from the Danish; Arwidsson, 36. The
resemblance is close to 'Ingelilles Bryllup,' <b>C</b>, Grundtvig, 276.
See also, further on, 'The Twa Knights.'</p>

<p>The Billie Blin presents himself in at least four Scottish ballads:
<a href="#Version_5_C">'Gil Brenton,' <b>C</b></a>; <a href="#Ballad_6">'Willie's Lady;'</a> one version of <a href="#Ballad_53">'Young
Beichan;'</a> two of 'The Knight and Shepherd's Daughter;' and also in
the English ballad of 'King Arthur and the King of Cornwall,' here
under the slightly disfigured name of Burlow Beanie.<a name="FNanchor_1_99" id="FNanchor_1_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> In all he is
a serviceable household demon; of a decidedly benignant disposition
in the first four, and, though a loathly fiend with seven heads in
the last, very obedient and useful when once thoroughly subdued. He
is clearly of the same nature as the Dutch <i>belewitte</i> and German
<i>bilwiz</i>, characterized by Grimm as a friendly domestic genius,
<i>penas</i>, <i>guote holde</i>; and the names are actually associated in a
passage cited by Grimm from Voet: "De illis quos nostrates appellant
<i>beeldwit et blinde belien</i>, a quibus nocturna visa videri atque ex iis
arcana revelari putant."<a name="FNanchor_1_100" id="FNanchor_1_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> Though the etymology of these words is
not unencumbered with difficulty, <i>bil</i> seems to point to a just and
kindly-tempered being. Bilvís, in the seventh book of Saxo Grammaticus,
is an aged counsellor whose bent is to make peace, while his brother
Bölvís, a blind man, is a strife-breeder and mischief-maker.<a name="FNanchor_1_101" id="FNanchor_1_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>
The same opposition of Bil and Böl apparently occurs in the Edda,
Grímnismál, 47<sup>4</sup>, where Bil-eygr and Böl-eygr (Bal-eygr) are
appellatives of Odin, which may signify mild-eyed and evil-eyed. Bölvís
is found again in the Hrômund's saga, under the description of 'Blind
the Bad,' and 'the Carl Blind whose name was Bavís.' But much of this
saga is taken from the story of Helgi Hundingslayer; and Blind the Bad
in the saga is only Sæmund's Blindr inn bölvísi,&mdash;the blind man whose
baleful wit sees through the disguise of Helgi, and all but betrays
the rash hero to his enemies; that is, Odin in his malicious mood
(Bölverkr), who will presently be seen in the ballad of <a href="#Ballad_7">'Earl Brand'</a>
masking as Old Carl Hood, "aye for ill and never for good." Originally
and properly, perhaps, only the bad member of this mythical pair is
blind; but it would not be at all strange that later tradition, which
confuses and degrades so much in the old mythology, should transfer
blindness to the good-natured one, and give rise to the anomalous
Billie Blind. See Grimm, Deutsche Mythologie, 1879, <span class="smcap">I</span>, 391

than his usual discretion: "The ballad of Bothwell, Cospatric, or Gil
Brenton, appears to be copied from an account of the birth of Makbeth
given by Wintown." The substance of this account is, that Macbeth's
mother had a habit of repairing to the woods for wholesome air, and
that, during one of her rambles, she fell in with a fair man, really
the Devil, who passed the day with her, and got on her a son.

WILLIE'S LADY</h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><b>a.</b> 'Willie's Lady,' Fraser-Tytler MS.</p>

<p><b>b.</b> 'Sweet Willy,' Jamieson-Brown MS., No 15, fol. 33.</p></div>


<p><b>a</b>, 'Willie's Lady,' was No 1 in the manuscript of fifteen
ballads furnished William Tytler by Mrs Brown in 1783, and having
been written down a little later than <b>b</b> may be regarded as a
revised copy. This manuscript, as remarked under No 5, is not now in
the possession of the Fraser-Tytler family, having often been most
liberally lent, and, probably, at last not returned. But a transcript
had been made by the grandfather of the present family of two of the
pieces contained in it, and 'Willie's Lady' is one of these two.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-82" id="Pg_1-82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>Lewis had access to William Tytler's copy, and, having regulated the
rhymes, filled out a gap, dropped the passage about the girdle, and
made other changes to his taste, printed the ballad in 1801 as No 56 of
his Tales of Wonder. The next year Scott gave the "ancient copy, never
before published," "in its native simplicity, as taken from Mrs Brown
of Falkland's MS.,"&mdash;William Tytler's,&mdash;in Minstrelsy of the Scottish
Border, <span class="smcap">II</span>, 27, but not with literal accuracy. Jamieson,
in 1806, gave 'Sweet Willy,' almost exactly according to the text
of his Brown manuscript, in an appendix to the second volume of his
collection, p. 367, and at p. 175 of the same volume, a reconstruction
of the ballad which might have been spared.</p>

<p><b>b</b> lacks altogether the passage which makes proffer of the cup,
<b>a</b>, stanzas 5-11, and substitutes at that place the girdle of
<b>a</b> 21-28. The woodbine in <b>a</b> 36, 41, is also wanting,
and the concluding stanza. A deficiency both in matter and rhyme at
<b>a</b> 32, is supplied by <b>b</b> 25, 26, but not happily:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'An do you to your mither then,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An bid her come to your boy's christnen;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'For dear's the boy he's been to you:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then notice well what she shall do.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Again, the transition in <b>a</b>, from st. 33 to st. 34, is abrupt
even for a ballad, and <b>b</b> introduces here four stanzas narrating
the execution of the Billy Blind's injunctions, and ending,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And notic'd well what she did say,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>whereby we are prepared for the witch's exclamations.<a name="FNanchor_1_102" id="FNanchor_1_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>Danish versions of this ballad are numerous: <b>A-I</b>, 'Hustru
og Mands Moder' ['Fostermoder,' 'Stifmoder'], Grundtvig, No 84,
<span class="smcap">II</span>, 404 ff; <b>J-T</b>, 'Hustru og Mands Moder,' Kristensen,
<span class="smcap">II</span>, 111 ff, No 35: <b>U-X</b>,'Barselkvinden,' Kristensen,
<span class="smcap">I</span>, 201 ff, No 74; <b>Y</b>, 'Hustru og Slegfred,' Grundtvig,
No 85, <span class="smcap">II</span>, 448 ff: in all twenty-five, but many of
Kristensen's copies are fragments. Grundtvig's 84 <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>,
and 85 <b>a</b> are from manuscripts of the sixteenth century. 84
<b>F-I</b> and several repetitions of 85 are of the seventeenth.
Grundtvig's 84 <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, and all Kristensen's
versions, are from recent oral tradition. Some of these, though taken
down since 1870, are wonderfully well preserved.</p>

<p>The Danish ballads divide into two classes, principally distinguished
by their employing or not employing of the artifice of wax children.
(There is but one of these in <b>N</b>, <b>R</b>, Kristensen's
<b>E</b>, <b>I</b>, <span class="smcap">II</span>, 116, 122, and in the oldest Swedish
ballad, as in the Scottish: but children in Scandinavian ballads are
mostly born in pairs.) Of the former class, to which our only known
copy belongs, are <b>F-I</b>, <b>N-T</b>, <b>X</b> (Grundtvig, 84
<b>F-I</b>, Kristensen, <span class="smcap">II</span>, No 35, <b>E-L</b>, <span class="smcap">I</span>,
No 74 <b>D</b>). <b>N</b> and <b>I</b> furnish, perhaps, the most
consistent story, which, in the former, runs thus: Sir Peter married
Ellen (elsewhere Mettelille, Kirstin, Tidelil, Ingerlil), and gave
her in charge to his mother, a formidable witch, and, as appears from
<b>F</b>, violently opposed to the match. The first night of her
marriage Ellen conceived twins. She wrapped up her head in her cloak
and paid a visit to her mother-in-law, to ask how long women go with
child. The answer was,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Forty weeks went Mary with Christ,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so each Danish woman must.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Forty weeks I went with mine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But eight years shalt thou go with thine.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The forty weeks had passed, and Ellen began to long for relief. Sir
Peter besought aid of his sister Ingerlin. If I help your young bride,
she said, I must be traitor to my mother. Sir Peter insisted, and
Ingerlin moulded a fine child of wax,<a name="FNanchor_1_103" id="FNanchor_1_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> wrapped it in linen, and
exhibited it to her mother, who, supposing that her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-83" id="Pg_1-83">[Pg 83]</a></span> arts had been
baffled, burst out into exclamations of astonishment. She had thought
she could twist a rope out of flying sand, lay sun and moon flat on the
earth with a single word, turn the whole world round about! She had
thought all the house was spell-bound, except the spot where the young
wife's chest stood, the chest of red rowan, which nothing can bewitch!
The chest was instantly taken away, and Ellen's bed moved to the place
it had occupied; and no sooner was this done than Ellen gave birth to
two children.</p>

<p>In the ballads of the other class, the young wife, grown desperate
after eight years of suffering, asks to be taken back to her maiden
home. Her husband's mother raises objections: the horses are in the
meadow, the coachman is in bed. Then, she says, I will go on my bare
feet. The moment her husband learns her wish, the carriage is at the
door, but by the arts of the mother it goes to pieces on the way, and
the journey has to be finished on horseback. The joy of her parents
at seeing their daughter approaching was quenched on a nearer view:
she looked more dead than quick. She called her family about her and
distributed her effects. A great wail went up in the house when two
sons were cut from the mother's side. (<b>C</b>, <b>J</b>, <b>K</b>,
<b>L</b>, <b>W</b>: Grundtvig, 84 <b>C</b>; Kristensen, <span class="smcap">II</span>, No

</div></div>

<p>Several of the most important ballads of the first class have taken
up a part of the story of those of the second class, to the detriment
of consistency. <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>O</b>, <b>P</b>
(Grundtvig, 84 <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>, Kristensen, <span class="smcap">II</span>,
No 35 <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>), make the wife quit her husband's house for
her father's, not only without reason, but against reason. If the woman
is to die, it is natural enough that she should wish to die with the
friends of her early days, and away from her uncongenial mother-in-law;
but there is no kind of occasion for transferring the scene of the
trick with the wax children to her father's house; and, on the other
hand, it is altogether strange that her husband's mother and the
rowan-tree chest (which sometimes appears to be the property of the
mother, sometimes that of the wife) should go with her.</p>

<p><b>Y</b>, 'Hustru og Slegfred,' Grundtvig, 85, agrees with the second
class up to the point when the wife is put to bed at her mother's
house, but with the important variation that the spell is the work of
a former mistress of the husband; instead of his mother, as in most of
the ballads, or of the wife's foster-mother, as in <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>,
<b>J</b>, <b>K</b>, <b>M</b> (Grundtvig, 84 <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>,
Kristensen, <span class="smcap">II</span>, No 35 <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>D</b>), or of the
wife's step-mother as in <b>A</b> only. The conclusion of 'Hustru og
Slegfred' is rather flat. The wife, as she lies in bed, bids all her
household hold up their hands and pray for her relief, which occurs on
the same day. The news is sent to her husband, who rejoins his wife,
is shown his children, praises God, and burns his mistress. Burning is
also the fate of the mother-in-law in <b>B</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>O</b>,
<b>P</b>, whereas in <b>F</b> she dies of chagrin, and in <b>G</b>
bursts into a hundred flinders (flentsteene).</p>

<p>This ballad, in the mixed form of <b>O</b>, <b>P</b> (Kristensen,
<span class="smcap">II</span>, 35 <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>), has been resolved into a tale
in Denmark, a few lines of verse being retained. Recourse is had by
the spell-bound wife to a cunning woman in the village, who informs
her that in her house there is a place in which a rowan-tree chest
has stood, and that she can get relief there. The cunning woman
subsequently pointing out the exact spot, two boys are born, who are
seven years old, and can both walk and talk. Word is sent the witch
that her son's wife has been delivered of two sons, and that she
herself shall be burned the day following. The witch says, "I have been
able to twine a string out of running water. If I have not succeeded in
bewitching the woman, she must have found the place where the damned
rowan chest stood." (Grundtvig, <span class="smcap">III</span>, 858, No 84 <b>b</b>.)</p>

<p>Three Swedish versions of the ballad have been printed. <b>A</b>,
<b>B</b>, from tradition of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-84" id="Pg_1-84">[Pg 84]</a></span> century, are given by Arwidsson,
<span class="smcap">II</span>, 252 ff, 'Liten Kerstins Förtrollning,' No 134. These
resemble the Danish ballads of the second class closely. Liten Kerstin
goes to her mother's house, gives birth to two children, and dies. In
<b>A</b> the children are a son and daughter. The son stands up, combs
his hair, and says, "I am forty weeks on in my ninth year." He can run
errands in the village, and the daughter sew red silk. In <b>B</b> both
children are boys. One combs his hair, and says, "Our grandmother shall
be put on two wheels." The other draws his sword, and says, "Our mother
is dead, our grandmother to blame. I hope our mother is with God. Our
grandmother shall be laid on seven wheels." The other copy, <b>C</b>,
mentioned by Grundtvig as being in Cavallius and Stephens' manuscript
collection, has been printed in the Svenska Fornminnesföreningens
Tidskrift, vol. ii, p. 72 ff, 1873-74. It dates from the close of the
sixteenth century, and resembles the mixed ballads of the Danish first
class, combining the flitting to the father's house with the artifice
of the wax children. The conclusion of this ballad has suffered
greatly. After the two sons are born, we are told that Kirstin, before
unmentioned, goes to the chest and makes a wax child. If the chest were
moved, Elin would be free of her child. And then the boy stands up and
brushes his hair, and says he has come to his eighth year.</p>

<p>Three stanzas and some of the incidents of a <b>Norwegian</b> version
of this ballad have been communicated to Grundtvig, <span class="smcap">III</span>,
858 f, No 84 c, by Professor Sophus Bugge. The only place which was
unaffected by a spell was where Signelíti's bride-chest stood, and the
chest being removed, the birth took place. The witch was a step-mother,
as in Danish <b>A</b>.</p>

<p>There are two familiar cases of malicious arrest of childbirth in
classic mythology,&mdash;those of Latona and Alcmene. The wrath of Juno
was the cause in both, and perhaps the myth of Alcmene is only a
repetition of an older story, with change of name. The pangs of
Latona were prolonged through nine days and nights, at the end of
which time Ilithyia came to her relief, induced by a bribe. (Hymn to
the Delian Apollo, 91 ff.) Homer, Il. xix, 119, says only that Hera
stopped the delivery of Alcmene and kept back Ilithyia. Antoninus
Liberalis, in the second century of our era, in one of his abstracts
from the Metamorphoses of Nicander, a poem of the second century <span class="smcap">B.
C.</span>, or earlier, has this account: that when Alcmene was going
with Hercules, the Fates and Ilithyia, to please Juno, kept her in her
pains by sitting down and folding their hands; and that Galinthias, a
playmate and companion of Alcmene, fearing that the suffering would
drive her mad, ran out and announced the birth of a boy, upon which the
Fates were seized with such consternation that they let go their hands,
and Hercules immediately came into the world. (Antoninus Lib., Metam.
c. xxix.) Ovid, Metamorphoses, ix, 281-315, is more circumstantial.
After seven days and nights of torture, Lucina came, but, being bribed
by Juno, instead of giving the aid for which she was invoked, sat down
on the altar before Alcmene's door, with the right knee crossed over
the left, and fingers interlocked, mumbling charms which checked the
processes of birth. Galanthis, a servant girl <i>media de plebe</i>, was
shrewd enough to suspect that Juno had some part in this mischief; and
besides, as she went in and out of the house, she always saw Lucina
sitting on the altar, with her hands clasped over her knees. At last,
by a happy thought, she called out, "Whoever you are, wish my mistress
joy; she is lighter, and has her wish." Lucina jumped up and unclasped
her hands, and the birth followed instantly. Pausanias, ix, 11, tells
a similar but briefer story, in which Historis, daughter of Tiresias,
takes the place of Galanthis. See, for the whole matter, 'Ilithyia oder
die Hexe,' in C. A. Böttiger's Kleine Schriften, <span class="smcap">I</span>, 76 ff.</p>

<p>Apuleius, in his Metamorphoses, mentions a case of suspended
childbirth, which, curiously enough, had lasted eight years,<a name="FNanchor_1_105" id="FNanchor_1_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> as
in the Dan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-85" id="Pg_1-85">[Pg 85]</a></span>ish and Swedish ballads. The witch is a mistress of her
victim's husband, as in Grundtvig, 85, and as in a story cited by
Scott from Heywood's 'Hierarchy of the Blessed Angels,' p. 474. "There
is a curious tale about a Count of Westeravia [Vestravia, in diocesi
Argentoratensi], whom a deserted concubine bewitched upon his marriage,
so as to preclude all hopes of his becoming a father. The spell
continued to operate for three years, till one day, the count happening
to meet with his former mistress, she maliciously asked him about the
increase of his family. The count, conceiving some suspicion from her
manner, craftily answered that God had blessed him with three fine
children; on which she exclaimed, like Willie's mother in the ballad,
'May Heaven confound the old hag by whose counsel I threw an enchanted
pitcher into the draw-well of your palace!' The spell being found and
destroyed, the count became the father of a numerous family."</p>

<p>A story like that of the ballad is told as a fact that took place
in Arran within this century. A young man forsook his sweetheart
and married another girl. When the wife's time came, she suffered
excessively. A pack-man who was passing suspected the cause, went
straight to the old love, and told her that a fine child was born; when
up she sprang, and pulled out a large nail from the beam of the roof,
calling out to her mother, "Muckle good your craft has done!" The wife
was forthwith delivered. (Napier, in The Folklore Record, <span class="smcap">II</span>,
117.)</p>

<p>In the <b>Sicilian</b> tales, collected by Laura Gonzenbach, Nos 12
and 15, we have the spell of folded hands placed between the knees to
prevent birth, and in No 54 hands raised to the head.<a name="FNanchor_1_106" id="FNanchor_1_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> In all these
examples the spell is finally broken by telling the witch a piece of
false news, which causes her to forget herself and take away her hands.
(Sicilianische Märchen aus dem Volksmund gesammelt, Leipzig, 1870.)</p>

<p>We find in a <b>Roumanian</b> tale, contributed to Das Ausland for
1857, p. 1029, by F. Obert, and epitomized by Grundtvig, <span class="smcap">III</span>,
859, No 84 d, a wife condemned by her offended husband to go with child
till he lays his hand upon her. It is twenty years before she obtains
grace, and the son whom she then bears immediately slays his father. A
<b>Wallachian</b> form of this story (Walachische Märchen von Arthur u.
Albert Schott, No 23) omits the revenge by the new-born child, and ends
happily.</p>

<p>With respect to the knots in st. 34, it is to be observed that the
tying of knots (as also the fastening of locks), either during the
marriage ceremony or at the approach of parturition was, and is still,
believed to be effectual for preventing conception or childbirth. The
minister of Logierait, Perthshire, testifies, about the year 1793,
that immediately before the celebration of a marriage it is the custom
to loosen carefully every knot about bride and bridegroom,&mdash;garters,
shoe-strings, etc. The knots are tied again before they leave the
church. (Statistical Account of Scotland, <span class="smcap">V</span>, 83.) So among the
Laps and Norwegians, when a child is to be born, all the knots in the
woman's clothes, or even all the knots in the house, must be untied,
because of their impeding delivery. (Liebrecht, Zur Volkskunde, p. 322,
who also cites the Statistical Account of Scotland.)</p>

<p>'Earl Brand,' first given to the world by Mr Robert Bell in 1857,
has preserved most of the incidents of a very ancient story with a
faithfulness unequalled by any ballad that has been recovered from
English oral tradition. Before the publication of 'Earl Brand,' <b>A
c</b>, our known inheritance in this particular was limited to the
beautiful but very imperfect fragment called by Scott 'The Douglas
Tragedy,' <b>B</b>; half a dozen stanzas of another version of the
same in Motherwell's Minstrelsy, <b>E</b>; so much of Percy's 'Child
of Elle' as was genuine, which, upon the printing of his manuscript,
turned out to be one fifth, <b>F</b>; and two versions of Erlinton,
<b>A</b>, <b>C</b>.<a name="FNanchor_1_107" id="FNanchor_1_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> What now can be added is but little: two
transcripts of 'Earl Brand,' one of which, <b>A a</b>, has suffered
less from literary revision than the only copy hitherto printed, <b>A
c</b>; a third version of 'The Douglas Tragedy,' from Motherwell's
manuscript, <b>C</b>; a fourth from Kinloch's manuscripts, <b>D</b>;
and another of 'Erlinton,' <b>B</b>. Even 'Earl Brand' has lost a
circumstance that forms the turning-point in Scandinavian ballads, and
this capital defect attends all our other versions, though traces which
remain in '<a href="#Ballad_8">Erlinton</a>' make it nearly certain that our ballads originally
agreed in all important particulars with those which are to this day
recited in the north of Europe.</p>

<p>The corresponding <b>Scandinavian</b> ballad is 'Ribold and Guldborg,'
and it is a jewel that any clime might envy. Up to the time of
Grundtvig's edition, in Danmarks gamle Folkeviser, No 82, though
four versions had been printed, the only current copy for a hundred
and fifty years had been Syv's No 88, based on a broadside of the
date 1648, but compounded from several sources; and it was in this
form that the ballad became known to the English through Jamieson's
translation. Grundtvig has now published twenty-seven versions of
'Ribold og Guldborg' (<span class="smcap">II</span>, 347 ff, nineteen; 675 ff, four;
<span class="smcap">III</span>, 849 ff, four:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-89" id="Pg_1-89">[Pg 89]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_1_108" id="FNanchor_1_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> of all which only two are fragments),
and nine of 'Hildebrand og Hilde,' No 83, which, is the same story
set in a dramatic frame-work (<span class="smcap">II</span>, 393 ff, seven; 680 f,
one; <span class="smcap">III</span>, 857, one, a fragment). Three more Danish versions
of 'Ribold og Guldborg' are furnished by Kristensen, Gamle jydske
Folkeviser, <span class="smcap">I</span>, No 37, <span class="smcap">II</span>, No 84 <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>
(<b>C*</b>, <b>D*</b>, <b>E*</b>). To these we may add the last half,
sts 15-30, of 'Den farlige Jomfru,' Grundtvig, 184 <b>G</b>. Of
Grundtvig's texts, 82 <b>A</b> is of the sixteenth century; <b>B-H</b>
are of the seventeenth; the remainder and Kristensen's three from
recent tradition. Six versions of 'Hildebrand og Hilde,' <b>A-F</b>,
are of the seventeenth century; one is of the eighteenth, <b>G</b>; and
the remaining two are from oral tradition of our day.</p>

<p>The first six of Grundtvig's versions of 'Ribold and Guldborg,'
<b>A-F</b>, are all from manuscripts, and all of a pure traditional
character, untampered with by "collators." <b>G</b> and <b>H</b> are
mixed texts: they have <b>F</b> for their basis, but have admitted
stanzas from other sources. Most of the versions from recitation are
wonderful examples and proofs of the fidelity with which simple people
"report and hold" old tales: for, as the editor has shown, verses
which never had been printed, but which are found in old manuscripts,
are now met with in recited copies; and these recited copies, again,
have verses that occur in no Danish print or manuscript, but which
nevertheless are found in Norwegian and Swedish recitations, and, what
is more striking, in Icelandic tradition of two hundred years' standing.</p>

<p>The story in the older Danish ballads runs thus. Ribold, a king's son,
sought Guldborg's love in secret. He said he would carry her to a land
where death and sorrow came not; where all the birds were cuckoos,
and all the grass was leeks, and all the streams ran wine. Guldborg,
not indisposed, asked how she should evade the watch kept over her
by all her family and by her betrothed. Ribold disguised her in his
cloak and armor, <b>B</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, and rode off, with
Guldborg behind him. On the heath they meet a rich earl [a crafty man,
<b>C</b>; her betrothed, <b>D</b>], who asks, Whither away, with your
stolen maid? [little page, <b>B</b>, <b>F</b>.] Ribold replies that it
is his youngest sister, whom he has taken from a cloister, <b>A</b>,
<b>E</b> [sick sister, <b>C</b>; brother, <b>B</b>, <b>F</b>; page,
<b>D</b>]. This shift avails nothing; no more does a bribe which he
offers for keeping his secret. Report is at once made to her father
that Guldborg has eloped with Ribold. Guldborg perceives that they are
pursued, and is alarmed. Ribold reassures her, and prepares to meet his
foes. He bids Guldborg hold his horse, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>E</b>,
and, whatever may happen, not to call him by name: "Though thou see me
bleed, name me not to death; though thou see me fall, name me not at
all!" Ribold cuts down six or seven of her brothers and her father,
besides others of her kin; the youngest brother only is left, and
Guldborg in an agony calls upon Ribold to spare him, to carry tidings
to her mother. No sooner was his name pronounced than Ribold received
a mortal wound. He sheathed his sword, and said, Come, wilt thou ride
with me? Wilt thou go home to thy mother again, or wilt thou follow so
sad a swain? And she answered, I will not go home to my mother again; I
will follow thee, my heart's dearest man. They rode through the wood,
and not a word came from the mouth of either. Guldborg asked, Why art
thou not as glad as before? And Ribold answered, Thy brother's sword
has been in my heart. They reached his house. He called to one to take
his horse, to another to bring a priest, and said his brother should
have Guldborg. But she would not give her faith to two brothers. Ribold
died that night, <b>C</b>. Three dead came from Ribold's bower: Ribold
and his lief, and his mother, who died of grief! In <b>A</b> Guldborg
slays herself, and dies in her lover's arms.</p>

<p>'Hildebrand and Hilde,' <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, opens
with the heroine in a queen's service, sewing her seam wildly, putting
silk for gold and gold for silk. The queen calls her to account. Hilde
begs her mistress to listen to her tale of sorrow. She was a king's
daughter. Twelve knights had been appointed to be her guard, and one
had beguiled her, Hildebrand, son of the king of England. They went
off together,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-90" id="Pg_1-90">[Pg 90]</a></span> and were surprised by her brothers [father, <b>B</b>,
<b>C</b>, <b>D</b>]. Hildebrand bade her be of good cheer; but she must
not call him by name if she saw him bleed or fall, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>,
<b>D</b>. A heap of knights soon lay at his feet. Hilde forgot herself,
and called out, Hildebrand, spare my youngest brother! Hildebrand that
instant received a mortal wound, and fell. The younger brother tied
her to his horse, and dragged her home. They shut her up at first in
a strong tower, built for the purpose, <b>A</b>,<b> B</b> [Swedish
<b>A</b>, a dark house], and afterwards sold her into servitude for a
church bell. Her mother's heart broke at the bell's first stroke, and
Hilde, with the last word of her tale, fell dead in the queen's arms.</p>

<p>The most important deviation of the later versions from the old is
exhibited by <b>S</b> and <b>T</b>, and would probably be observed in
<b>Q</b>, <b>R</b>, as well, were these complete. <b>S</b>, <b>T</b>
are either a mixture of 'Ribold and Guldborg' with 'Hildebrand and
Hilde,' or forms transitional between the two. In these Ribold does
not live to reach his home, and Guldborg, unable to return to hers,
offers herself to a queen, to spin silk and weave gold [braid hair and
work gold]. But she cannot sew for grief. The queen smacks her on the
cheek for neglecting her needle. Poor Guldborg utters a protest, but
gives no explanation, and the next morning is found dead. Singularly
enough, the name of the hero in <b>Q</b>, <b>R</b>, <b>S</b>, <b>T</b>,
is also an intermediate form. Ribold is the name in all the old Danish
copies except <b>C</b>, and that has Ride-bolt. Danish <b>I</b>,
<b>K</b>, <b>X</b>, <b>Z</b>, all the Icelandic copies, and Swedish
<b>D</b>, have either Ribold or some unimportant variation. <b>Q</b>,
<b>R</b>, <b>S</b>, have Ride-brand [<b>T</b>, Rederbrand]. All copies
of Grundtvig 83, except Danish <b>G</b>, Swedish <b>C</b>, which do not
give the hero's name, have Hilde-brand; so also 82 <b>N</b>, <b>O</b>,
<b>P</b>, <b>V</b>, and Kristensen, <span class="smcap">I</span>, No 37. The name of the
woman is nearly constant both in 82 and 83.</p>

<p>The paradise promised Guldborg in all the old versions of 82<a name="FNanchor_1_109" id="FNanchor_1_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>
disappears from the recited copies, except <b>K</b>, <b>M</b>. It
certainly did not originally belong to 'Ribold and Guldborg,' or to
another Danish ballad in which it occurs ('Den trofaste Jomfru,'
Grundtvig, 249 <b>A</b>), but rather to ballads like 'Kvindemorderen,'
Grundtvig, 183 <b>A</b>, or 'Líti Kersti,' Landstad, 44, where a
supernatural being, a demon or a hillman, seeks to entice away a mortal
maid. See No 4, p. 27. In 82 <b>L</b>, <b>N</b>, <b>U</b>, <b>V</b>,
<b>Y</b>, <b>Æ</b>, <b>Ø</b>, and Kristensen's copies, the lovers are
not encountered by anybody who reports their flight. Most of the later
versions, <b>K</b>, <b>L</b>, <b>M</b>, <b>N</b>, <b>P</b>, <b>U</b>,
<b>V</b>, <b>Y</b>, <b>Æ</b>, <b>Ø</b>, and Kristensen's three, make
them halt in a wood, where Ribold goes to sleep in Guldborg's lap, and
is roused by her when she perceives that they are pursued. So Norwegian
<b>B</b>, Swedish <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, and 'Hildebrand and
Hilde' <b>B</b>. <b>M</b>, <b>Q</b>, <b>R</b>, <b>S</b>, <b>T</b>,
<b>Z</b>, have not a specific prohibition of <i>dead-naming</i>, but even
these enjoin silence. 83 <b>C</b> is the only ballad in which there is
a fight and no prohibition of either kind, but it is clear from the
course of the story that the stanza containing the usual injunction
has simply dropped out. <b>P</b> is distinguished from all other forms
of the story by the heroine's killing herself before her dying lover
reaches his house.</p>

<p>The four first copies of 'Hildebrand and Hilde,' as has been seen, have
the story of Ribold and Guldborg with some slight differences and some
abridgment. There is no elopement in <b>B</b>: the lovers are surprised
in the princess' bower. When Hilde has finished her tale, in <b>A</b>,
the queen declares that Hildebrand was her son. In <b>B</b> she
interrupts the narrative by announcing her discovery that Hildebrand
was her brother. <b>C</b> and <b>D</b> have nothing of the sort. There
is no fight in <b>E-H</b>. <b>E</b> has taken up the commonplace of the
bower on the strand which was forced by nine men.<a name="FNanchor_1_110" id="FNanchor_1_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> Hildebrand is
again the son of the queen, and, coming in just as Hilde has expired,
exclaims that he will have no other love, sets his sword against a
stone, and runs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-91" id="Pg_1-91">[Pg 91]</a></span> upon it. <b>H</b> has the same catastrophe. <b>F</b>
represents the father as simply showing great indignation and cruelty
on finding out that one of the guardian knights had beguiled his
daughter, and presently selling her for a new church bell. The knight
turns out here again to be the queen's son; the queen says he shall
betroth Hille, and Hille faints for joy. <b>G</b> agrees with <b>B</b>
as to the surprise in the bower. The knight's head is hewn off on the
spot. The queen gives Hilde her youngest son for a husband, and Hilde
avows that she is consoled. <b>I</b> agrees with <b>E</b> so far as it
goes, but is a short fragment.</p>

<p>There are three <b>Icelandic</b> versions of this ballad, 'Ribbalds
kvæði,' Íslenzk Fornkvæði, No 16, all of the seventeenth century.
They all come reasonably close to the Danish as to the story, and
particularly <b>A</b>. Ribbald, with no prologue, invites Gullbrún "to
ride." He sets her on a white horse; of all women she rode best. They
have gone but a little way, when they see a pilgrim riding towards
them, who hails Ribbald with, Welcome, with thy stolen maid! Ribbald
pretends that the maid is his sister, but the pilgrim knows very well
it is Gullbrún. She offers her cloak to him not to tell her father, but
the pilgrim goes straight to the king, and says, Thy daughter is off!
The king orders his harp to be brought, for no purpose but to dash it
on the floor once and twice, and break out the strings. He then orders
his horse. Gullbrún sees her father come riding under a hill-side, then
her eleven brothers, then seven brothers-in-law. She begs Ribbald to
spare her youngest brother's life, that he may carry the news to her
mother. He replies, I will tie my horse by the reins; you take up your
sewing! then three times forbids her to name him during the fight. He
slew her father first, next the eleven brothers, then the other seven,
all which filled her with compunction, and she cried out, Ribbald,
still thy brand! On the instant Ribbald received many wounds. He wiped
his bloody sword, saying, This is what you deserve, Gullbrún, but love
is your shield; then set her on her horse, and rode to his brother's
door. He called out, Here is a wife for you! But Gullbrún said, Never
will I be given to two brothers. Soon after Ribbald gave up the ghost.
There was more mourning than mirth; three bodies went to the grave in
one coffin, Ribbald, his lady, and his mother, who died of grief.</p>

<p><b>B</b> and <b>C</b> have lost something at the beginning, <b>C</b>
starting at the same point as our 'Douglas Tragedy.' The king pursues
Ribbald by water. Gullbrún (<b>B</b>) stands in a tower and sees him
land. Ribbald gives Gullbrún to his brother, as in <b>A</b>: she lives
in sorrow, and dies a maid.</p>

<p><b>Norwegian.</b> ('Ribold and Guldborg.') <b>A</b>, 'Rikeball og
stolt Guðbjörg,' Landstad, 33; <b>B</b>, 'Veneros og stolt Ölleber,'
Landstad, 34; <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, in part described
and cited, with six other copies, Grundtvig, <span class="smcap">III</span>, p. 853 f.
The last half of Landstad No 23, stanzas 17-34, and stanzas 18-25 of
Landstad 28 <b>B</b>, also belong here. <b>A</b> agrees with the older
Danish versions, even to the extent of the paradise. <b>B</b> has been
greatly injured. Upon the lady's warning Veneros of the approach of
her father, he puts her up in an oak-tree for safety. He warns her not
to call him by name, and she says she will rather die first; but her
firmness is not put to the test in this ballad, some verses having
dropped out just at this point. Veneros is advised to surrender, but
dispatches his assailants by eighteen thousands (like Lille brór, in
Landstad, 23), and by way of conclusion hews the false Pál greive, who
had reported his elopement to Ölleber's father, into as many pieces.
He then takes Ölleber on his horse, they ride away and are married.
Such peculiarities in the other copies as are important to us will be
noticed further on.</p>

<p>('Hildebrand and Hilde.') <b>A</b>, one of two Norwegian copies
communicated by Professor Bugge to Grundtvig, <span class="smcap">III</span>, 857 f,
agrees well with Danish <b>E</b>, but has the happy conclusion of
Danish <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>I</b>. The heroine is sold for <i>nine</i>
bells. <b>B</b>, the other, omits the bower-breaking of <b>A</b> and
Danish <b>E</b>, and ends with marriage.</p>

<p>The <b>Swedish</b> forms of 'Ribold and Guldborg' are: <b>A</b>,
'Hillebrand,' Afzelius, No 2; <b>B</b>, 'Herr Redebold,' and <b>C</b>,
'Kung Vallemo,'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-92" id="Pg_1-92">[Pg 92]</a></span> Afzelius, No 80; new ed., No 2, <span class="smcap">1, 2,
3</span>; <b>D</b>, 'Ribbolt,' Arwidsson, No 78; <b>E</b>, 'Herr
Redebold' <b>F</b>, 'Herting Liljebrand,' and <b>G</b>, 'Herr Balder,'
in Cavallius and Stephens' manuscript collection; <b>H</b>, 'Kung
Walmon,' E. Wigström's Folkdiktning, No 15, p. 33. <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>,
<b>C</b>, <b>H</b>, are not markedly different from the ordinary
Danish ballad, and this is true also, says Grundtvig, of the unprinted
versions, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>. <b>D</b> and <b>G</b> are of
the seventeenth century, the others from recent tradition. Ribold is
pictured in <b>D</b> as a bold prince, equally versed in runes and arts
as in manly exercises. He visits Giötha by night: they slumber sweet,
but wake in blood. She binds up his wounds with rich kerchiefs. He
rides home to his father's, and sits down on a bench. The king bids his
servants see what is the matter, and adds, Be he sick or be he hurt,
he got it at Giötha-Lilla's. They report the prince stabbed with sharp
pikes within, and bound with silk kerchiefs without. Ribold bids them
bury him in the mould, and not blame Giötha-Lilla; "for my horse was
fleet, and I was late, and he hurtled me 'gainst an apple-tree" (so
Hillebrand in <b>A</b>). <b>E</b> represents the heroine as surviving
her lover, and united to a young king, but always grieving for Redebold.</p>

<p>'Hildebrand and Hilde' exists in Swedish in three versions: <b>A</b>,
a broadside of the last part of the seventeenth century, now printed
in the new edition of Afzelius, p. 142 ff of the notes (the last nine
stanzas before, in Danske Viser, <span class="smcap">III</span>, 438 f); <b>B</b>,
Afzelius, No 32, new ed. No 26, <b>C</b>, Arwidsson, No 107, both
taken down in this century. In <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> Hillebrand, son
of the king of England, carries off Hilla; they halt in a grove; she
wakes him from his sleep when she hears her father and seven brothers
coming; he enjoins her not to call him by name, which still she does
upon her father's being slain [or when only her youngest brother is
left], and Hillebrand thereupon receives mortal wounds. He wipes his
sword, saying, This is what you would deserve, were you not Hilla.
The youngest brother ties Hilla to his horse, drags her home, and
confines her in a dark house, which swarms with snakes and dragons
(<b>A</b> only). They sell her for a new church bell, and her mother's
heart breaks at the first sound. Hilla falls dead at the queen's knee.
<b>C</b> has lost the dead-naming, and ends with the queen's promising
to be Hilla's best friend.</p>

<p>A detailed comparison of the English ballads, and especially of
'Earl Brand,' with the Scandinavian (such as Grundtvig has made,
<span class="smcap">III</span>, 855 f) shows an unusual and very interesting agreement.
The name Earl Brand, to begin with, is in all probability a
modification of the Hildebrand found in Danish 82 <b>N</b>, <b>O</b>,
<b>P</b>, <b>V</b>, <b>C*</b>, in all versions of Danish 83, and in the
corresponding Swedish <b>A</b>. Ell, too, in Percy's fragment, which
may have been Ellë earlier, points to Hilde, or something like it, and
Erl-inton might easily be corrupted from such a form as the Alibrand
of Norwegian <b>B</b> (Grundtvig, <span class="smcap">III</span>, 858). Hildebrand is
the son of the king of England in Danish 83 <b>A-E</b>, and the lady
in 'Earl Brand' is the same king's daughter, an interchange such as is
constantly occurring in tradition. Stanza 2 can hardly be the rightful
property of 'Earl Brand.' Something very similar is met with in
'Leesome Brand,' and is not much in place there. For 'old Carl Hood,'
of whom more presently, Danish 82 <b>X</b> and Norwegian <b>A</b>,
<b>C</b> have an old man, Danish <b>C</b> a crafty man, <b>T</b> a
false younker, and Norwegian <b>B</b> and three others "false Pál
greive." The lady's urging Earl Brand to slay the old carl, and the
answer, that it would be sair to kill a gray-haired man, sts 8, 9, are
almost literally repeated in Norwegian <b>A</b>, Landstad, No 33. The
knight does slay the old man in Danish <b>X</b> and Norwegian <b>C</b>,
and slays the court page in Danish <b>Z</b>, and false Pál greive in
Norwegian <b>B</b>,&mdash;in this last <i>after</i> the battle. The question,
"Where have ye stolen this lady away?" in st. 11, occurs in Danish 82
<b>A</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>K</b>, <b>P</b>, <b>R</b>, <b>S</b>,
<b>T</b>, <b>Z</b>, in Norwegian <b>B</b> and Icelandic <b>B</b>, and
something very similar in many other copies. The reply, "She is my
sick sister, whom I have brought from Winchester" [nunnery], is found
almost literally in Danish <b>C</b>, <b>X</b>, <b>Z</b>: "It is my sick
sister; I took her yesterday from the cloister." [Danish <b>E</b>, it
is my youngest sister from the cloister; she is sick: Danish <b>A</b>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-93" id="Pg_1-93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
youngest sister from cloister: Danish <b>R</b> and Norwegian <b>B</b>,
sister from cloister: Danish <b>S</b>, <b>T</b>, sister's daughter from
cloister: Norwegian <b>F</b>, sister from Holstein: Danish <b>P</b>,
Icelandic <b>A</b>, Norwegian <b>A</b>, sister.] The old man, crafty
man, rich earl, in the Scandinavian ballads, commonly answers that he
knows Guldborg very well; but in Danish <b>D</b>, where Ribold says
it is a court page he has hired, we have something like sts 14, 15:
"Why has he such silk-braided hair?" On finding themselves discovered,
the lovers, in the Scandinavian ballad, attempt to purchase silence
with a bribe: Danish <b>A-I</b>, <b>M</b>, Icelandic and Norwegian
<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>. This is not expressly done in 'Earl Brand,' but
the same seems to be meant in st. 10 by "I'll gie him a pound." St. 17
is fairly paralleled by Danish <b>S</b>, 18, 19: "Where is Guldborg,
thy daughter? Walking in the garden, gathering roses;" and st. 18, by
Norwegian <b>B</b>, 15: "You may search without and search within, and
see whether Ölleber you can find." The announcement in st. 19 is made
in almost all the Scandinavian ballads, in words equivalent to "Ribold
is off with thy daughter," and then follows the arming for the pursuit.
The lady looks over her shoulder and sees her father coming, as in st.
21, in Danish 82 <b>A</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>Q</b>,
<b>R</b>, <b>T</b>, <b>X</b>, <b>Z</b>, and Norwegian <b>A</b>.</p>

<p>The scene of the fight is better preserved in the Scottish ballads
than in 'Earl Brand,' though none of these have the cardinal incident
of the death-naming. All the Scottish versions, <b>B-F</b>, and also
'Erlinton,' <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, make the lady hold the knight's
horse: so Danish 82 <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>Æ</b>,
<b>D*</b>, Icelandic <b>C</b>, Norwegian and Swedish <b>A</b>, and
Danish 83 <b>D</b>. Of the knight's injunction, "Name me not to death,
though thou see me bleed," which, as has been noted, is kept by nearly
every Danish ballad (and by the Icelandic, the Norwegian, and by
Swedish 'Ribold and Guldborg,' <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>H</b>,
Swedish 'Hildebrand and Hilde,' <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>), there is left
in English only this faint trace, in 'Erlinton,' <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>:
"See ye dinna change your cheer until ye see my body bleed." It is
the wish to save the life of her youngest brother that causes the
lady to call her lover by name in the larger number of Scandinavian
ballads, and she adds, "that he may carry the tidings to my mother," in
Danish 82 <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>,
<b>H</b>, <b>M</b>, <b>X</b>, 83 <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>. Grief
for her father's death is the impulse in Danish 82 <b>I</b>, <b>N</b>,
<b>O</b>, <b>Q</b>, <b>R</b>, <b>S</b>, <b>Y</b>, <b>Z</b>, <b>Æ</b>,
<b>Ø</b>, <b>A*</b>, <b>C*</b>, <b>D*</b>, <b>E*</b>, Swedish <b>A</b>,
<b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>H</b>. English <b>A</b> says nothing of father
or brother; but in <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, it is the
father's death that causes the exclamation. All the assailants are
slain in 'Erlinton' <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, except an aged knight [the
auldest man], and he is spared to carry the tidings home. 'Erlinton'
<b>C</b>, however, agrees with the oldest Danish copies in making
the youngest brother the motive of the lady's intervention. It is
the fifteenth, and last, of the assailants that gives Earl Brand his
death-wound; in Danish <b>H</b>, the youngest brother, whom he has
been entreated to spare; and so, apparently, in Danish <b>C</b> and
Norwegian <b>A</b>.</p>

<p>The question, "Will you go with me or return to your mother?" which we
find in English <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, is met with also in many
Danish versions, 82 <b>B</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>K</b>, <b>L</b>, <b>M</b>,
<b>N</b>, <b>P</b>, <b>U</b>, <b>Z</b>, <b>Æ</b>, <b>Ø</b>, <b>C*</b>,
and Swedish <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>. The dying man asks to have
his bed made in English <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, as in Danish 82 <b>B</b>,
<b>C</b>, <b>K</b>, <b>L</b>, <b>N</b>, <b>U</b>, <b>N</b>, <b>Æ</b>,
<b>Ø</b>, <b>C*</b>, <b>D*</b>, Norwegian <b>A</b>, Swedish <b>A</b>,
<b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>H</b>, and desires that the lady may marry his
brother in English <b>A</b>, as in nearly all the Danish versions,
Icelandic <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, Norwegian <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>,
<b>E</b>, Swedish <b>C</b>. He declares her a maiden true in 'Earl
Brand,' <b>A c</b> 33, and affirms the same with more particularity in
Danish 82 <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>M</b>,
<b>Ø</b>, Icelandic <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, Norwegian <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>,
<b>E</b>, Swedish <b>C</b>. The growth of the rose and brier [bush and
brier] from the lovers' grave in English <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, is not met
with in any version of 'Ribold and Guldborg' proper, but 'Den farlige
Jomfru' <b>G</b>, Grundtvig, 184, the last half of which, as already
remarked, is a fragment of a Ribold ballad, has a linden in place of
the rose and brier.</p>

<p>No complete ballad of the Ribold class is known to have survived in
<b>German</b>, but a few verses have been interpolated by tradition in
the earliest copy of the Ulinger ballad (vv. 47-56), which may almost
with certainty be assigned to one of the other description.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-94" id="Pg_1-94">[Pg 94]</a></span> They
disturb the narrative where they are, and a ready occasion for their
slipping in was afforded by the scene being exactly the same in both
ballads: a knight and a lady, with whom he had eloped, resting in a
wood.<a name="FNanchor_1_111" id="FNanchor_1_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> See No 4, p. 32 of this volume.</p>

<p>We find in a pretty <b>Neapolitan-Albanian</b> ballad, which, with
others, is regarded by the editors as a fragment of a connected poem,
several of the features of these northern ones. A youth asks a damsel
in marriage, but is not favored by her mother, father, or brother. He
wins over first the mother and then the father by handsome presents,
but his gifts, though accepted, do not conciliate the brother. He
carries off the lady on horseback, and is attacked by the brother, four
uncles, and seven cousins. He is killed and falls from his horse; with
him the lady falls dead also, and both are covered up with stones. In
the spring the youth comes up a cypress, the damsel comes up a vine,
and encloses the cypress in her arms. (Rapsodie d'un poema albanese
raccolte nelle colonie del Napoletano, de Rada and de' Coronei,
Florence, 1866, lib. ii., canto viii.)</p>

<p>These ballads would seem to belong among the numerous ramifications
of the Hilde saga. Of these, the second lay of Helgi Hundingslayer,
in Sæmund's Edda, and 'Waltharius,' the beautiful poem of Ekkehard,
are most like the ballads.<a name="FNanchor_1_112" id="FNanchor_1_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> Leaving 'Waltharius' till we come
to 'Erlinton,' we may notice that Sigrún, in the Helgi lay, though
promised by her father to another man, Hödbrodd, son of Granmar,
preferred Helgi. She sought him out, and told him frankly her
predicament: she feared, she said, the wrath of her friends, for
breaking her father's promise. Helgi accepted her affection, and
bade her not care for the displeasure of her relatives. A great
battle ensued between Helgi and the sons of Granmar, who were
aided by Sigrún's father and brothers. All her kinsmen were slain
except one brother, Dag. He bound himself to peace with Helgi, but,
notwithstanding, made sacrifices to Odin to obtain the loan of his
spear, and with it slew Helgi. We have, therefore, in so much of the
lay of Helgi Hundingslayer, the groundwork of the story of the ballads:
a woman, who, as in many of the Ribold ballads, has been betrothed to a
man she does not care for, gives herself to another; there is a fight,
in which a great number of her kinsmen fall; one brother survives, who
is the death of the man she loves. The lay of Helgi Hiörvard's son,
whose story has much in common with that of his namesake, affords two
resemblances of detail not found in the lay of the Hundingslayer. Helgi
Hiörvard's son, while his life-blood is ebbing, expresses himself in
almost the words of the dying Ribold: "The sword has come very near my
heart." He then, like Ribold and Earl Brand, declares his wish that
his wife should marry his brother, and she, like Guldborg, declines a
second union.<a name="FNanchor_1_113" id="FNanchor_1_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-95" id="Pg_1-95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>There is also a passage in the earlier history of Helgi Hundingslayer
of which traces appear to be preserved in ballads, and before all in
the English ballad 'Earl Brand,' <b>A</b>. Hunding and Helgi's family
were at feud. Helgi introduced himself into Hunding's court as a spy,
and when he was retiring sent word to Hunding's son that he had been
there disguised as a son of Hagal, Helgi's foster-father. Hunding
sent men to take him, and Helgi, to escape them, was forced to assume
woman's clothes and grind at the mill. While Hunding's men are making
search, a mysterious blind man, surnamed the bale-wise, or evil-witted
(Blindr inn bölvísi), calls out, Sharp are the eyes of Hagal's maid;
it is no churl's blood that stands at the mill; the stones are riving,
the meal-trough is springing; a hard lot has befallen a war-king when
a chieftain must grind strange barley; fitter for that hand is the
sword-hilt than the mill-handle. Hagal pretends that the fierce-eyed
maid is a virago whom Helgi had taken captive, and in the end Helgi
escapes. This malicious personage reappears in the Hrômund saga as
"Blind the Bad" and "the Carl Blind, surnamed Bavís," and is found
elsewhere. His likeness to "old Carl Hood," who "comes for ill, but
never for good," and who gives information of Earl Brand's flight
with the king's daughter, does not require to be insisted on. Both
are identical, we can scarcely doubt, with the blind [one-eyed] old
man of many tales, who goes about in various disguises, sometimes as
beggar, with his hood or hat slouched over his face,&mdash;that is Odin,
the Síðhöttr or Deep-hood of Sæmund, who in the saga of Hálf and
his champions is called simple Hood, as here, and expressly said to
be Odin.<a name="FNanchor_1_114" id="FNanchor_1_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> Odin, though not a thoroughly malignant divinity, had
his dark side, and one of his titles in Sæmund's Edda is Bölverkr,
<i>maleficus</i>. He first caused war by casting his spear among men, and
Dag, after he has killed Helgi, says Odin was the author of all the
mischief, for he brought strife among kinsmen.<a name="FNanchor_1_115" id="FNanchor_1_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>The disastrous effects of "naming" in a great emergency appear in other
northern traditions, though not so frequently as one would expect. A
diverting Swedish saga, which has been much quoted, relates how St.
Olof bargained with a troll for the building of a huge church, the pay
to be the sun and moon, or St. Olof himself. The holy man was equally
amazed and embarrassed at seeing the building run up by the troll with
great rapidity, but during a ramble among the hills had the good luck
to discover that the troll's name was Wind and Weather, after which
all was easy. For while the troll was on the roof of the church, Olof
called out to him,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Wind and Weather, hi!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You've set the spire awry;'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and the troll, thus called by his name, lost his strength, fell off,
and was dashed into a hundred pieces, all flint stones. (Iduna, Part 3,
p. 60 f, note. Other forms of the same story in Afzelius, Sago-Häfder,
<span class="smcap">III</span>, 100 f; Faye, Norske Folke-Sagn, p. 14, 2d ed.; Hofberg,
Nerikes Gamla Minnen, p. 234.)</p>

<p>It is a Norwegian belief that when a nix assumes the human shape in
order to carry some one off, it will be his death if the selected
victim recognizes him and names him, and in this way a woman escaped in
a ballad. She called out, So you are the Nix, that pestilent beast, and
the nix "disappeared in red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-96" id="Pg_1-96">[Pg 96]</a></span> blood." (Faye, as above, p. 49, note.) A
nix is baffled in the same way in a Færoe and an Icelandic ballad cited
by Grundtvig, <span class="smcap">II</span>, 57.</p>

<p>The marvellous horse Blak agrees to carry Waldemar [Hildebrand] over
a great piece of water for the rescue of his daughter [sister],
stipulating, however, that his name shall not be uttered. The rider
forgets himself in a panic, calls to the horse by his name, and
is thrown off into the water. The horse, whose powers had been
supernatural, and who had been <i>running</i> over the water as if it were
land, has now only ordinary strength, and is forced to swim. He brings
the lady back on the same terms, which she keeps, but when he reaches
the land he is bleeding at every hair, and falls dead. (Landstad, 58;
Grundtvig, 62; Afzelius, 59, preface; Kristensen, <span class="smcap">I</span>, No 66.)</p>

<p>Klaufi, a berserker, while under the operation of his peculiar fury,
loses his strength, and can no longer wield the weapon he was fighting
with, upon Gríss's crying out, "Klaufi, Klaufi, be not so mad!"
(Svarfdæla Saga, p. 147, and again p. 156 f.) So the blood-thirst of
the avenger's sword in the magnificent Danish ballad 'Hævnersværdet' is
restrained by naming. (Grundtvig, No 25, st. 35.) Again, men engaged
in <i>hamfarir</i>, that is in roving about in the shape of beasts, their
proper bodies remaining lifeless the while, must not be called by name,
for this might compel them to return at once to their own shape, or
possibly prevent their ever doing so. (Kristni Saga, ed. 1773, p. 149.
R.T. King, in Notes and Queries, 2d Ser., <span class="smcap">II</span>, 506.) Grundtvig
remarks that this belief is akin to what is related in Fáfnismál (prose
interpolation after st. 1), that Sigurd concealed his name by reason of
a belief in old times that a dying man's word had great power, if he
cursed his foe by name. (D.g.F., <span class="smcap">II</span>, 340.)</p>

<p>The beautiful fancy of plants springing from the graves of star-crossed
lovers, and signifying by the intertwining of stems or leaves, or in
other analogous ways, that an earthly passion has not been extinguished
by death, presents itself, as is well known, very frequently in popular
poetry. Though the graves be made far apart, even on opposite sides
of the church, or one to the north and one to the south outside of
the church, or one without kirk wall and one in the choir, however
separated, the vines or trees seek one another out, and mingle their
branches or their foliage:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Even from the tomb the voice of Nature cries,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even in our ashes live their wonted fires!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The principal ballads which exhibit this conception in one or another
form are the following:</p>

<p>In English, 'The Douglas Tragedy,' 'Fair Margaret and Sweet William,'
'Lord Thomas and Fair Annet,' 'Fair Janet,' 'Prince Robert,' 'Lord
Lovel.' The plants in all these are either a brier and a rose, or a
brier and a birk.</p>

<p><b>Swedish.</b> Arwidsson, No 73: the graves are made east and west
of the church, a linden grows from each, the trees meet over the
church roof. So E. Wigström, Folkdiktning, No 20, p. 42. Arwidsson 74

were brought up by divers and buried in the church, where the marvel
was repeated.</p>

<p>The idea of the love-animated plants has been thought to be derived
from the romance of Tristan, where it also occurs; agreeably to a
general principle, somewhat hastily assumed, that when romances and
popular ballads have anything in common, priority belongs to the
romances. The question as to precedence in this instance is an open
one, for the fundamental conception is not less a favorite with ancient
Greek than with mediæval imagination.</p>

<p>Tristan and Isolde had unwittingly drunk of a magical potion which had
the power to induce an indestructible and ever-increasing love. Tristan
died of a wound received in one of his adventures, and Isolde of a
broken heart, because, though summoned to his aid, she arrived too late
for him to profit by her medical skill. They were buried in the same
church. According to the French prose romance, a green brier issued
from Tristan's tomb, mounted to the roof, and, descending to Isolde's
tomb, made its way within. King Marc caused the brier to be cut down
three several times, but the morning after it was as flourishing as
before.<a name="FNanchor_1_116" id="FNanchor_1_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>Eilhart von Oberge, vv. 9509-21 (ed. Lichtenstein, Quellen u.
Forschungen, xix, 429) and the German prose romance (Büsching u. von
der Hagen, Buch der Liebe, c. 60), Ulrich von Thürheim, vv. 3546-50,
and Heinrich von Freiberg, vv. 6819-41 (in von der Hagen's ed. of
G.v. Strassburg's Tristan) make King Marc <i>plant</i>, the first two a
grape-vine over Tristan and a rose over Isolde, the others, wrongly,
the rose over Tristan and the vine over Isolde. These plants, according
to Heinrich, struck their roots into the hearts of the lovers below,
while their branches embraced above. Icelandic ballads and an Icelandic
saga represent Tristan's wife as forbidding the lovers to be buried in
the same grave, and ordering them to be buried on opposite sides of the
church. Trees spring from their bodies and meet over the church roof,
(Íslenzk Fornkvæði, 23 <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>; Saga
af Tristram ok Ísönd, Brynjulfson, p. 199; Tristrams Saga ok Ísondar,
Kölbing, p. 112). The later Titurel imitates the conclusion of Tristan.
(Der jüngere Titurel, ed. Hahn, sts 5789, 5790.)</p>

<p>Among the miracles of the Virgin there are several which are closely
akin to the prodigies already noted. A lily is found growing from
the mouth of a clerk, who, though not leading an exemplary life, had
every day said his ave before the image of Mary: Unger, Mariu Saga, No
50; Berceo, No 3; Miracles de N.D. de Chartres, p. lxiii, No 29, and
p. 239; Marien-legenden (Stuttgart, 1846), No xi and p. 269. A rose
springs from the grave and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-99" id="Pg_1-99">[Pg 99]</a></span> roots in the heart of a knight who had
spared the honor of a maid because her name was Mary: Unger, No clvi,
Hagen's Gesammtabenteuer, lxxiii. Roses inscribed Maria grow from the
mouth, eyes, and ears of a monk: Unger, cxxxvii; and a lily grows over
a monk's grave, springing from his mouth, every leaf of which bears Ave
Maria in golden letters: Unger, cxxxviii; Gesammtabenteuer, lxxxviii;
Libro de Exenplos, Romania, 1878, p. 509, 43, 44; etc., etc.</p>

<p>No one can fail to be reminded of the purple, lily-shaped flower,
inscribed with the mournful AI AI, that rose from the blood of
Hyacinthus, and of the other from the blood of Ajax, with the same
letters, "his name and eke his plaint," hæc nominis, illa querellæ.
(Ovid, Met. <span class="smcap">X</span>, 210 ff; xiii, 394 ff.) The northern lindens
have their counterpart in the elms from the grave of Protesilaus, and
in the trees into which Philemon and Baucis were transformed. See, upon
the whole subject, the essay of Koberstein in the Weimar Jahrbuch,
<span class="smcap">I</span>, 73 ff, with Köhler's supplement, p. 479 ff; Grimm, Deutsche
Mythologie, <span class="smcap">II</span>, 689 f, and <span class="smcap">III</span>, 246.</p>

<p>"The ballad of the 'Douglas Tragedy,'" says Scott, "is one of the
few to which popular tradition has ascribed complete locality. The
farm of Blackhouse, in Selkirkshire, is said to have been the scene
of this melancholy event. There are the remains of a very ancient
tower, adjacent to the farm-house, in a wild and solitary glen, upon
a torrent named Douglas burn, which joins the Yarrow after passing a
craggy rock called the Douglas craig.... From this ancient tower Lady
Margaret is said to have been carried by her lover. Seven large stones,
erected upon the neighboring heights of Blackhouse, are shown, as
marking the spot where the seven brethren were slain; and the Douglas
burn is averred to have been the stream at which the lovers stopped to
drink: so minute is tradition in ascertaining the scene of a tragical
tale, which, considering the rude state of former times, had probably
foundation in some real event."</p>

<p>The localities of the Danish story were ascertained, to her entire
satisfaction, by Anne Krabbe in 1605-6, and are given again in Resen's
Atlas Danicus, 1677. See Grundtvig, <span class="smcap">II</span>, 342 f.</p>

Hilde saga. The hero kills six of seven brothers [also the father, in

slain by him. The youngest brother carries her lover's head to his
sister, is invited to drink by her (in three of the four copies), and
slain while so engaged; reminding us of Hildina in the Shetland ballad.
Danish 'Herr Hjælm,' Grundtvig, Danske Folkeminder, 1861, p. 81, agrees
with the Swedish, except that there are only three brothers.</p></div>

Fornaldar Sögur, <span class="smcap">II</span>, p. 25. Klee observes, p. 10 f, that
Högni [Hagen] is the evil genius of the Hildesage. Sometimes he is the
heroine's father; in 'Waltharius,' strangely enough, the hero's old
friend (and even there a one-eyed man.) Klee treats the introduction
of a rival lover (as in the Shetland ballad and Gudrun) as a departure
from the older story. But we have the rival in Helgi Hundingslayer.
The proper marplot in this lay is Blind the Ill-witted (Odin), whose
part is sustained in 'Earl Brand' by the malicious Hood, in several
Norwegian ballads by a very enigmatical "false Pál greive," in two
other Norwegian ballads and one Danish by an old man, and, what is most
remarkable, in the Shetland ballad by the rejected lover of Hildina
(the Sir Nilaus of Danish <b>D</b>, Hertug Nilssón of some Norwegian

ERLINTON</h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><b><a href="#Version_8_A">A</a>.</b> 'Erlinton,' Scott's Minstrelsy, <span class="smcap">III</span>, 235,
ed. 1803.</p>

<p><b><a href="#Version_8_B">B</a>.</b> 'True Tammas,' Mr R. White's papers.</p>

<p><b><a href="#Version_8_C">C</a>.</b> 'Robin Hood and the Tanner's Daughter,' Gutch's Robin
Hood, <span class="smcap">II</span>, 345.</p></div>


<p>'Erlinton' (<b>A</b>) first appeared in the Minstrelsy of the Scottish
Border, the text formed "from the collation of two copies obtained
from recitation." <b>B</b> is a manuscript copy, furnished by the
late Mr Robert White of Newcastle, and was probably taken down from
recitation by Mr James Telfer early in the century. <b>C</b>, in which
Robin Hood has taken the place of a hero who had at least <i>connections</i>
out of Great Britain, was first printed in Gutch's Robin Hood, from a
manuscript of Mr Payne Collier, supposed to have been written about
1650.</p>

<p>This ballad has only with much hesitation been separated from the
foregoing. In this as in that, a man induces a maid to go off with
him; he is set upon by a party of fifteen in <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, as
in 7 <b>A</b>; and he spares the life of one of his assailants [an
old man, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, the younger brother, <b>C</b>]. Some
agreements as to details with Scandinavian Ribold ballads have already
been noticed, and it has been observed that while there is no vestige
of the dead-naming in 'Earl Brand,' there is an obvious trace of it in
'Erlinton' <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>. 'Erlinton' <b>A</b>, <b>B</b> has also
one other correspondence not found in 'Earl Brand,'&mdash;the strict watch
kept over the lady (st. 2). Even the bigly bower, expressly built to
confine her in, is very likely a reminiscence or a displacement of
the tower in which Hilde is shut up, <i>after</i> her elopement, in some
of the Scandinavian ballads (Danish 83 <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>; Swedish
<b>A</b>, dark house). But notwithstanding these resemblances to the
Ribold story, there is a difference in the larger part of the details,
and all the 'Erlinton' ballads have a fortunate conclusion, which also
does not seem forced, as it does in Arwidsson, 107, the only instance,
perhaps, in which a fortunate conclusion in a Ribold ballad is of the
least account; for Grundtvig's <b>F</b>, <b>G</b> are manifestly copies
that have been tampered with, and Landstad 34 is greatly confused at
the close. It may be an absolute accident, but 'Erlinton' <b>A</b>,
<b>B</b> has at least one point of contact with the story of Walter of
Aquitania which is not found in '<a href="#Ballad_7">Earl Brand</a>.' This story requires to be
given in brief on account of its kinship to both.</p>

<p>Walter, with his betrothed Hildegunde, fly from the court of Attila,
at which they have both lived as hostages since their childhood,
taking with them two boxes of jewels. Gunther, king of Worms, learns
that a knight and lady, with a richly-laden horse, have passed the
Rhine, and sets out in pursuit, with twelve of his best fighting men,
resolved to capture the treasure. The fugitives, after a very long
ride, make a halt in a forest, and Walter goes to sleep with his head
on Hildegunde's knees. The lady meanwhile keeps watch, and rouses her
lover when she perceives by the dust they raise that horsemen are
approaching. Gunther sends one of his knights with a message demanding
the surrender of the treasure. Walter scornfully refuses, but expresses
a willingness to make the king a present of a hundred bracelets, or
rings, of red gold, in token of his respect. The messenger is sent back
with directions to take the treasure by force, if it should be refused
again. Walter, having vainly offered a present of two hundred bracelets
to avoid a conflict, is attacked by the knight, whom he slays. Ten
others go the way of this first, and only the king and one of his
troop, Hagen, a very distinguished knight and an old comrade of Walter,
remain. These now attack Walter; the combat is long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-107" id="Pg_1-107">[Pg 107]</a></span> and fierce; all
three are seriously wounded, and finally so exhausted as to be forced
to cease fighting. Walter and Hagen enter into a friendly talk while
refreshing themselves with wine, and in the end Gunther<a name="FNanchor_1_117" id="FNanchor_1_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> is put
on a horse and conducted home by Hagen, while Walter and Hildegunde
continue their journey to Aquitania. There they were married and ruled
thirty happy years. ('Waltharius,' ed. R. Peiper, 1873.)</p>

<p>The particular resemblances of 'Erlinton' <b>A</b>, <b>B</b> to
'Walter' are that the assailants are "bold knights," or "bravest
outlaws," <i>not</i> the lady's kinsmen; that there are two parleys before
the fight; and that the hero survives the fight and goes off with his
love. The utmost that could be insisted on is that some features of
the story of Walter have been blended in the course of tradition with
the kindred story of Ribold. 'Erlinton' <b>C</b> is much less like
'Walter,' and more like 'Ribold.'</p>

<p>The 'Sultan's Fair Daughter,' translated by Aigner, Ungarische
Volksdichtungen, p. 93, 2d ed., has perhaps derived something from the
Walter story. Two Magyars escape from the Sultan's prison by the aid of
his daughter, under promise of taking her to Hungary. She often looks
backwards, fearing pursuit. At last a large band overtake them. One of
the Magyars guards the lady; the other assaults the Turks, of whom he
leaves only one alive, to carry back information. One of the two has a
love at home; the other takes the Sultan's daughter.</p>

<p>The earliest copy of this ballad is introduced as 'The Maidens'
Song,'<a name="FNanchor_1_119" id="FNanchor_1_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> in Deloney's Pleasant History of John Winchcomb, in his
younger yeares called Jacke of Newberie, a book written as early as
1597. Mr Halliwell reprinted the "9th" edition, of the date 1633,<a name="FNanchor_1_120" id="FNanchor_1_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>
in 1859, and the ballad is found at p. 61 of the reprint (<b>A</b>).
The copy in Ritson's Ancient Songs, 1790, p. 169, has a few variations,
which are probably to be explained by Ritson having used some other
edition of Deloney. Ritson's text is used in The Border<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-112" id="Pg_1-112">[Pg 112]</a></span>er's Table
Book, <span class="smcap">VI</span>, 25, and was taken thence into Sheldon's Minstrelsy
of the English Border, with some arbitrary alterations. The ballad was
formerly popular in Scotland. Kinloch and Buchan printed <b>B</b> and
<b>C</b> with some slight changes; the texts are now given as they
stand in the manuscripts. <b>E</b>, a traditional version from the
English border, has unfortunately been improved by some literary pen.</p>

<p>An English lady is prevailed upon to release a Scot from prison, and
to fly with him, on the promise of being made his wife, and (<b>A</b>)
lady of castles and towers. She takes much gold with her (<b>A</b>),
and a swift steed (two, <b>A</b>). According to <b>A</b> they come to
a rough river; the lady is alarmed, but swims it, and is wet from top
to toe. On coming within sight of Edinburgh, the faithless knight bids
her choose whether she will be his paramour or go back: he has wife
and children. She begs him to draw his sword and end her shame: he
takes her horse away, and leaves her. Two English knights come by, who
restore her to her father. The dismissal takes place at the Scottish
cross and moor in <b>B</b>; at a moor and a moss, <b>C</b>; at Scotland
bridge, <b>D</b>; at a fair Scottish cross, <b>E</b>. She offers to
be servant in his kitchen rather than go back, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>,
<b>E</b>; begs him to throw her into the water, <b>D</b>; from his
castle wall, <b>E</b>. He fees an old man to take her home on an old
horse, <b>B</b>, <b>E</b>.</p>

<p>We do not find the whole of this story repeated among other European
nations, but there are interesting agreements in parts with
Scandinavian, Polish, and German ballads.</p>

<p>There is some resemblance in the first half to a pretty ballad of the
northern nations which treats in a brief way the theme of our exquisite
romance of 'The Nutbrown Maid:' <b>Danish</b>, 'Den Trofaste Jomfru,'
Grundtvig, No 249, <span class="smcap">IV</span>, 494, nine copies, <b>A-I</b>, the
first three from 16th or 17th century manuscripts, the others from
tradition of this century, as are also the following: <b>K-M</b>,
'Den Fredløse,' Kristensen, <span class="smcap">II</span>, 191, No 57: Swedish, 'De sju
Gullbergen,' <b>A</b>, Afzelius, No 79, <span class="smcap">III</span>, 71, new ed.,
No 64, <span class="smcap">I</span>, 322; <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, Grundtvig, <span class="smcap">IV</span>,
507 f: <b>Norwegian</b> <b>A</b>, 'Herre Per og stolt Margit,'
Landstad, No 74, p. 590; <b>B</b>, 'Herr' Nikelus,' Landstad, No 75,
p. 594.<a name="FNanchor_1_121" id="FNanchor_1_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> All tell very much the same tale. A knight carries off
a maid on his horse, making her magnificent promises, among which
are eight gold castles, Dan. <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>H</b>,
<b>I</b>; one, <b>K</b>, <b>L</b>, <b>M</b>; eight, Norw. <b>A</b>;
nine, Norw. <b>B</b>; seven, Swed. <b>B</b>; seven gold mountains,
Swed. <b>A</b>, perhaps, by mistake of ber<i>gen</i> for bor<i>gar</i><a name="FNanchor_1_122" id="FNanchor_1_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> She
gets her gold together while he is saddling his horse, Dan. <b>A,
C, D, F, H, M</b>; Swed. <b>A</b>; Norw. <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>. They
come to a sea-strand or other water, it is many miles to the nearest
land, Dan. <b>B</b>, <b>D</b>, Swed. <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>; the lady
wishes she were at home, Dan. <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, Swed. <b>B</b>,
<b>C</b>. He swims the horse across, Dan. <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>D</b>,
<b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>K</b>, <b>L</b>, <b>M</b>; Swed.
<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b> [part of the way, having started in a
boat, Norw. <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>]. The maid wrings her clothes, Dan.
<b>A</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>K</b>, <b>L</b>; Swed. <b>A</b>; Norw. <b>A</b>,
<b>B</b>. She asks, Where are the gold castles which you promised?
Dan. <b>C</b> 7, <b>D</b> 14, <b>K</b> 9, <b>L</b> 7, <b>M</b> 8;
Norw. <b>A</b> 22, <b>B</b> 16.<a name="FNanchor_1_123" id="FNanchor_1_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> He tells her that he has no gold
castle but this green turf, Dan. <b>C</b> 8; he needs none but the
black ground and thick wood, Dan. <b>K</b> 10: he is a penniless,
banished man. She offers him her gold to buy him a charter of peace.
In all, except Dan. <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, and the incomplete
Dan. <b>I</b>, Norw. <b>B</b>, he goes on to say that he has plighted
faith to another woman, and she meekly replies, Then I will be your
servant. He continues the trial no further, reveals himself as of
wealth and rank, says that she shall have ladies to wait on her, and
makes her his queen. The knight is king of England in Dan. <b>B</b>,
<b>H</b>, King Henry, simply, in Dan. <b>F</b>. The gold castles prove
to be realities: there is in Dan. <b>E</b> even one more than was
promised.<a name="FNanchor_1_124" id="FNanchor_1_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>The <b>Polish</b> ballads of the class of '<a href="#Ballad_4">Lady Isabel and the Elf
Knight</a>' (see p. <a href="#Pg_1-39">39</a> f) have thus much in common with 'The Fair Flower of
Northumberland:' a maid is induced to go off with a man on horseback,
and takes gold with her; after going a certain distance, he bids her
return home; in <b>AA</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>R</b>, he gives her her choice
whether to return or to jump into the river; she prefers death (cf.
<b>D</b> 3, 5, p. <a href="#Pg_1-116">116</a>); in all they finally come to a river, or other
water, into which he throws her.<a name="FNanchor_1_125" id="FNanchor_1_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>There is a <b>German</b> ballad which has some slight connection with
all the foregoing, and a very slight story it is altogether: 'Stolz
Heinrich,' Simrock, No 9, p. 23, 'Stolz Syburg,' Reiffenberg, No 16,
p. 32, No 17, p. 34, from the Lower Rhine and Münster; made over, in
Kretzschmer, <span class="smcap">I</span>, 187, No 106. Heinrich, or Syburg, wooes a
king's daughter in a distant land. He asks her to go with him, and says
he has seven mills in his country. "Tell me what they grind," says
Margaret, "and I will go with you." The mills grind sugar and cinnamon,
mace and cloves. They come to a green heath. Margaret thinks she sees
the mills gleaming: he tells her that a green heath is all he has.
"Then God have mercy that I have come so far," she says; draws a sword;
kneels before him, and stabs herself.</p>

<p>The ballad of '<a href="#Ballad_48">Young Andrew</a>,' further on, has points in common with
'The Fair Flower of Northumberland.'</p>

also in Kvindemorderen and Ribold ballads (our No 4, No 7), where also
a young woman is carried off furtively by a man. This is only what is
to be expected.</p></div>

between these Scandinavian ballads and 'Child Waters.' Child Waters
makes Ellen swim a piece of water, shows her his hall&mdash;"of red gold

to menial services, and finally, her patience withstanding all trials,
marries her.</p></div>

By a curious accident, it is at a wayside crucifix that the man begins
his change of demeanor in Polish <b>CC</b> 2 (Kolberg, <b>ddd</b>), as

<p>This is one of the very few old ballads which are not extinct as
tradition in the British Isles. Even drawing-room versions are spoken
of as current, "generally traced to some old nurse, who sang them
to the young ladies."<a name="FNanchor_1_126" id="FNanchor_1_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> It has been found in England, Scot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-119" id="Pg_1-119">[Pg 119]</a></span>land,
Wales, and Ireland, and was very early in print. Dr Rimbault possessed
and published a broadside of the date 1656<a name="FNanchor_1_127" id="FNanchor_1_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> (<b>A a</b>), and the
same copy is included in the miscellany called Wit Restor'd, 1658.
Both of these name "Mr Smith" as the author; that is, Dr James Smith,
a well-known writer of humorous verses, to whom the larger part of
the pieces in Wit Restor'd has been attributed. If the ballad were
ever in Smith's hands, he might possibly have inserted the three
burlesque stanzas, 11-13; but similar verses are found in another
copy (<b>L a</b>), and might easily be extemporized by any singer of
sufficiently bad taste. Wit and Drollery, the edition of 1682, has an
almost identical copy of the ballad, and this is repeated in Dryden's
Miscellany, edition of 1716, Part <span class="smcap">III</span>, p. 316. In 1781
Pinkerton inserted in his Tragic Ballads one with the title 'Binnorie,'
purporting to be from Scottish tradition. Of twenty-eight couplets,
barely seven are genuine. Scott printed in 1802 a copy (<b>C</b>)
compounded from one "in Mrs Brown's MS." (<b>B b</b>) and a fragment
of fourteen stanzas which had been transcribed from recitation by Miss
Charlotte Brooke, adopting a burden found in neither.<a name="FNanchor_1_128" id="FNanchor_1_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> Jamieson
followed, four years after, with a tolerably faithful, though not, as
he says, <i>verbatim</i>, publication of his copy of Mrs Brown's ballad,
somewhat marred, too, by acknowledged interpolations. This text of Mrs
Brown's is now correctly given, with the whole or fragments of eleven
others, hitherto unpublished.</p>

<p>The ballad is as popular with the Scandinavians as with their Saxon
cousins. Grundtvig, 'Den talende Strengeleg,' No 95, gives nine
<b>Danish</b> versions and one stanza of a tenth; seven, <b>A-E</b>,
in <span class="smcap">II</span>, 507 ff, the remainder, <b>H-K</b>, in <span class="smcap">III</span>,
875 ff. One more, <b>L</b>, is added by Kristensen, No 96, <span class="smcap">I</span>,
253. Of these, only <b>E</b> had been previously printed. All are from
tradition of this century.</p>

<p>There are two <b>Icelandic</b> versions, <b>A</b> from the 17th,
<b>B</b> from the 19th, century, printed in Íslenzk Fornkvæði, No 13,
'Hörpu kvæði.'</p>

<p>Of twelve <b>Norwegian</b> versions, <b>A</b>, by Moe, "is printed
in Norske Universitets og Skole-Annaler for 1850, p. 287," and in
Moe's Samlede Skrifter, <span class="smcap">II</span>, 118, 'Dæ bur ein Mann hær utmæ
Aa;' <b>B</b>, by Lindeman, Annaler, as before, "p. 496," and in his

<b>D-L</b> are described by Professor Bugge in Grundtvig, <span class="smcap">III</span>,
877 f; <b>M</b> "is printed in Illustreret Nyhedsblads Nytaarsgave for
1860, p. 77, Christiania."</p>

<p>Four <b>Färöe</b> versions are known: <b>A</b>, 'Hörpuríma,' "in
Svabo's MS., No 16, <span class="smcap">I</span>, 291," incorrectly printed by Afzelius,
<span class="smcap">I</span>, 86, and accurately, from a copy furnished by Grundtvig, in
Bergström's edition of Afzelius, <span class="smcap">II</span>, 69; <b>B</b>, a compound
of two versions taken down by Pastor Lyngbye and by Pastor Schröter,
in Nyeste Skilderie af Kjøbenhavn, 1821, col. 997 ff; <b>C</b>, a
transcript from recitation by Hammershaimb (Grundtvig); <b>D</b>, "in
Fugloyjarbók, No 31."</p>

<p><b>Swedish</b> versions are: <b>A</b>, 'Den underbara Harpan,'

Folksång, No 3, p. 10. Afzelius, moreover, gives variations from
four other copies which he had collected, <span class="smcap">III</span>, 20 ff, new
ed., <span class="smcap">II</span>, 74 ff; and Rancken from three others. Both of the
editors of the new Afzelius have recently obtained excellent copies
from singers. The ballad has also been found in Finnish, Bergström's
Afzelius, <span class="smcap">II</span>, 79.</p>

<p>There is a remarkable agreement between the Norse and English ballads
till we approach the conclusion of the story, with a natural diversity
as to some of the minuter details.</p>

<p>The sisters are king's daughters in English <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>,
<b>C</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>O</b> (?), <b>P</b>, <b>Q</b>, <b>R a</b>, and
in Swedish <b>B</b> and two others of Afzelius's versions. They are an
earl's daughters in Swedish <b>F</b>, and sink to farmer's daughters
in English <b>R b</b>, <b>c</b>,<a name="FNanchor_1_129" id="FNanchor_1_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> Swedish <b>A</b>, <b>G</b>,
Norwegian <b>C</b>.</p>

<p>It is a thing made much of in most of the Norse ballads that the
younger sister is fair and the older dark; the younger is bright as the
sun, as white as ermine or as milk, the elder black as soot, black as
the earth, Icelandic <b>A</b>, Swedish <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>G</b>,
Danish <b>A</b>, <b>D</b>, etc.; and this difference is often made the
ground for very unhandsome taunts, which qualify our compassion for the
younger; such as Wash all day, and you will be no whiter than God made
you, Wash as white as you please, you will never get a lover, Färöe
<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, Norwegian <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, etc. This contrast
may possibly be implied in "the youngest was the fairest flower,"
English <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>Q</b> ["sweetest," <b>D</b>], but is
expressed only in <b>M</b>, "Ye was fair and I was din" (dun), and in
<b>P a</b>, "The old was black and the young are fair."</p>

<p>The scene of action is a seashore in Icelandic and Färöe <b>A</b>,
<b>B</b>, Norwegian <b>A</b>, Swedish <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>G</b>,
<b>H</b>, and in all the Danish complete copies: a seashore, or a place
where ships come in, in English <b>A</b>, <b>B a</b>, <b>D-I</b>,
<b>Q</b>, <b>R a</b>, <b>T</b>, but in all save the last of these (the
last is only one stanza) we have the absurdity of a body drowned in
navigable water being discovered floating down a mill-stream.<a name="FNanchor_1_130" id="FNanchor_1_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> <b>B
c</b> has "the deep mill-dam;" <b>C</b> "the river-strand," perhaps one
of Scott's changes; <b>M</b>, "the dams;" <b>L</b>, <b>O</b>, <b>P</b>,
<b>R b c</b>, a river, Tweed mill-dam, or the water of Tweed. Norwegian
<b>B</b> has a river.</p>

<p>The pretence for the older sister's taking the younger down to the
water is in English <b>A-E</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>O</b>,
<b>Q</b>, to see their father's ships come in; in Icelandic <b>B</b>
to wash their silks;<a name="FNanchor_1_131" id="FNanchor_1_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> in most of the Norse ballads to wash
themselves, so that, as the elder says, "we may be alike white," Danish
<b>C-H</b>, Norwegian <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, Swedish <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>,
Färöe <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>. Malice prepense is attributed to the elder
in Swedish <b>B</b>, <b>F</b>, Norwegian C, Danish <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>,
<b>G</b>: but in Färöe <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, Norwegian <b>A</b>,
<b>B</b>, and perhaps some other cases, a previous evil intent is not
certain, and the provocations of the younger sister may excuse the
elder so far.</p>

<p>The younger is pushed from a stone upon which she sits, stands, or
steps, in English <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>E-H</b>, <b>M</b>, <b>O</b>,
<b>Q</b>, Icelandic <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, Färöe <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>,
Norwegian <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, Danish <b>A-E</b>, <b>H</b>,
<b>L</b>, Swedish <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>, and Rancken's other copies.</p>

<p>The drowning scene is the same in all the ballads, except as to one
point. The younger sister, to save her life, offers or consents to
renounce her lover in the larger number, as English <b>B-E</b>,
<b>G</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>M</b>, <b>P</b>, <b>Q</b>, Danish
<b>A-D</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>I</b>, Swedish <b>A-D</b>, <b>G</b>,
<b>H</b>; and in Icelandic <b>B</b> and "all the Färöe" ballads she
finally yields, after first saying that her lover must dispose of
himself. But Swedish <b>F</b>, with more spirit, makes the girl, after
promising everything else, reply:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Help then who can, help God above!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But ne'er shalt thou get my dear true-love.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In this refusal concur Icelandic <b>A</b>, Danish <b>E</b>, <b>H</b>,
<b>L</b>, and all the Norwegian versions except <b>L</b>.</p>

<p>Swedish <b>A</b>, <b>G</b>, and Rancken's versions (or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-121" id="Pg_1-121">[Pg 121]</a></span> two of them)
make the younger sister, when she sees that she must drown, send
greetings to her father, mother, true-love [also brother, sister,
Rancken], and add in each case that she is drinking, or dancing, her
bridal in the flood, that her bridal-bed is made on the white-sand, etc.</p>

<p>The body of the drowned girl is discovered, in nearly all the English
ballads, by some member of the miller's household, and is taken out of
the water by the miller. In <b>L b</b>, which, however, is imperfect at
the beginning, a harper finds the body. In the Icelandic ballads it is
found on the seashore by the lover; in all the Norwegian but <b>M</b>
by two fishermen, as also in Swedish <b>D</b> [fishermen in Swedish
<b>B</b>]; in all the Färöe versions and Norwegian <b>M</b> by two
"pilgrims;"<a name="FNanchor_1_132" id="FNanchor_1_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> in Danish <b>A-F</b>, <b>L</b>, and Swedish <b>C</b>
by two musicians, Danish <b>H</b>, Swedish <b>A</b>, <b>G</b>, one.
Danish <b>G</b>, which is corrupted at the close, has three musicians,
but these simply witness and report the drowning.</p>

<p>According to all complete and uncorrupted forms of the ballad, either
some part of the body of the drowned girl is taken to furnish a musical
instrument, a harp or a viol,<a name="FNanchor_1_133" id="FNanchor_1_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> or the instrument is wholly made
from the body. This is done in the Norse ballads by those who first
find the body, save in Swedish <b>B</b>, where fishermen draw the body
ashore, and a passing "speleman" makes the instrument. In English it
is done by the miller, <b>A</b>; by a harper, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>,
<b>G</b>, <b>L b</b> (the <i>king's</i> harper in <b>B</b>); by a fiddler,
<b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>L a</b> (?), <b>O</b>, <b>P</b> (the
<i>king's</i> fiddler, <b>O</b> (?), <b>P</b>); by both a fiddler and the
king's harper, <b>H</b>; in <b>F</b> by the father's herdsman, who
happens to be a fiddler.</p>

<p>Perhaps the original conception was the simple and beautiful one
which we find in English <b>B</b> and both the Icelandic ballads,
that the king's harper, or the girl's lover, takes three locks of her
yellow hair to string his harp with. So we find three tets of hair in
<b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>I</b>, and three links in <b>F</b>, <b>P</b>,
used, or directed to be used, to string the fiddle or the fiddle-bow,
and the same, apparently, with Danish <b>A</b>. Infelicitous additions
were, perhaps, successively made; as a harp-frame from the breast-bone
in English <b>C</b>, and fiddle-pins formed of the finger-joints,
English <b>F</b>, <b>O</b>, Danish <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>E</b>,
<b>F</b>, <b>L</b>. Then we have all three: the frame of the instrument
formed from the breast (or trunk), the screws from the finger-joints,
the strings from the hair, Swedish <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>G</b>,
Norwegian <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>M</b>. And so one thing and another
is added, or substituted, as fiddle-bows of the arms or legs, Swedish
<b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, Danish <b>H</b>, English <b>L a</b>; a harp-frame
from the arms, Norwegian <b>B</b>, Färöe <b>A</b>; a fiddle-frame from
the skull, Swedish <b>C</b>, or from the back-bone, English <b>L b</b>;
a <i>plectrum</i> from the arm, Färöe <b>B</b>; strings from the veins,
English <b>A</b>; a bridge from the nose, English <b>A</b>, <b>L a</b>;
"hørpønota" from the teeth, Norwegian <b>B</b>; till we end with the
buffoonery of English <b>A</b> and <b>L a</b>.</p>

<p>Swedish <b>H</b> has nothing about the finding of the body. Music is
wanted for the bridal, and a man from another village, who undertakes
to furnish it, looks three days for a proper tree to make a harp of.
The singer of this version supplied the information, lost from the
ballad, that the drowned sister had floated ashore and grown up into a
linden, and that this was the very tree which was chosen for the harp.
(See, further on, a Lithuanian, a Slovak, and an Esthonian ballad.)</p>

<p>All the Norse ballads make the harp or fiddle to be taken to a wedding,
which chances to be that of the elder sister with the drowned girl's
betrothed.<a name="FNanchor_1_134" id="FNanchor_1_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> Unfortunately, many of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-122" id="Pg_1-122">[Pg 122]</a></span> English versions are so
injured towards the close that the full story cannot be made out.
There is no wedding-feast preserved in any of them. The instrument,
in <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>H</b>, is taken into the king's
presence. The viol in <b>A</b> and the harp in <b>H</b> are expressly
said to speak. The harp is laid upon a stone in <b>C</b>, <b>J</b>,
and plays "its lone;" the fiddle plays of itself in <b>L b</b>.<a name="FNanchor_1_135" id="FNanchor_1_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>
<b>B</b> makes the harper play, and <b>D</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>K</b>,
<b>O</b>, which say the fiddle played, probably mean that there was a
fiddler, and so perhaps with all the Norse versions; but this is not
very material, since in either case the instrument speaks "with most
miraculous organ."</p>

<p>There are three strings made from the girl's hair in Icelandic
<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, English <b>B</b> [veins, English <b>A</b>], and
the three tets or links in English <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>,
<b>I</b>, <b>P</b> were no doubt taken to make three strings
originally. Corresponding to this are three enunciations of the
instrument in English <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, Icelandic <b>A</b>,
Färöe <b>A</b>,<a name="FNanchor_1_136" id="FNanchor_1_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> <b>B</b>, Swedish <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>,
<b>E</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>, Danish <b>A</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>F</b>,
<b>I</b>. These are reduced to two in Icelandic <b>B</b>, Danish
<b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>L</b>, Swedish <b>D</b>, and even
to one in English <b>D</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>K</b>, <b>O</b>,
but some of these have suffered injury towards the conclusion.
The number is increased to four in Norwegian <b>B</b>, to five in
Norwegian <b>A</b>, <b>D</b>, and even to six in Norwegian <b>C</b>,
<b>K</b>, <b>M</b>. The increase is, of course, a later exaggeration,
and very detrimental to the effect. In those English copies in which
the instrument speaks but once,<a name="FNanchor_1_137" id="FNanchor_1_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> <b>D</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>K</b>,
<b>O</b>, and we may add <b>P</b>, it expresses a desire for vengeance:
Hang my sister, <b>D</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>K</b>; Ye'll drown my sister, as
she's dune me, <b>O</b>; Tell him to burn my sister, <b>P</b>. This is
found in no Norse ballad, neither is it found in the earliest English
versions. These, and the better forms of the Norse, reveal the awful
secret, directly or indirectly, and, in the latter case, sometimes note
the effect on the bride. Thus, in Icelandic <b>B</b>, the first string
sounds, The bride is our sister; the second, The bride is our murderer.
In Danish <b>B</b> the first fiddle plays, The bride is my sister;
the second, The bridegroom is my true-love; in <b>C</b>, <b>H</b>,
the first strain is, The bride has drowned her sister, the second,
Thy sister is driven [blown] to land. Färöe <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, have:
(1) The bride was my sister; (2) The bride was my murderer; (3) The
bridegroom was my true-love. The bride then says that the harp disturbs
her much, and that she lists to hear it no more. Most impressive of
all, with its terse, short lines, is Icelandic <b>A</b>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The first string made response:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'The bride was my sister once.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The bride on the bench, she spake:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'The harp much trouble doth make.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The second string answered the other:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'She is parting me and my lover.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Answered the bride, red as gore:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'The harp is vexing us sore.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The canny third string replied:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'I owe my death to the bride.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He made all the harp-strings clang;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bride's heart burst with the pang.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This is the wicked sister's end in both of the Icelandic ballads and in
Färöe <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>. In Swedish <b>A</b>, <b>G</b>, at the first
stroke on the harp she laughs; at the second she grows pale [has to be
undressed]; upon the third she lay dead in her bed [falls dead on the
floor]. She is burned in Danish <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>F</b>,
<b>G</b>, Swedish <b>B</b>, Norwegian <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>,
<b>I</b>, <b>M</b>. In Norwegian <b>K</b>, <b>L</b>, the younger sister
(who is restored to life) begs that the elder may not be burned, but
sent out of the country (cf. English <b>R b c</b>); nevertheless, she
is buried alive in <b>L</b>, which is her fate also in <b>E</b>, and in
other unprinted versions. A prose comment upon Danish <b>I</b> has her
stabbed by the bridegroom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-123" id="Pg_1-123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>Norwegian <b>B</b> 21 makes the bride, in her confusion at the
revelations of the harp, ask the bridegroom to drive the fiddler out
of the house. So far from complying, the bridegroom orders him mead
and wine, and the bride to the pile. In Norwegian <b>C</b> the bride
treads on the harper's foot, then orders the playing to stop; but the
bridegroom springs from the table, and cries, Let the harp have its
song out, pays no regard to the lady's alleging that she has so bad a
head that she cannot bear it, and finally sends her to the pile. So,
nearly, Norwegian <b>A</b>. In Danish <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>,
<b>H</b>, <b>L</b>, vainly in the first two, the bride tries to hush
the fiddler with a bribe. He endeavors to take back what he has said
in <b>D</b>, <b>L</b>, declaring himself a drunken fool (the passage
is borrowed from another ballad): still in <b>L</b>, though successful
for the nonce, she comes to the stake and wheel some months after. In
<b>H</b> the fiddler dashes the instrument against a stone, seemingly
to earn his bribe, but this trait belongs to versions which take the
turn of the Norwegian. In <b>C</b> 15 the bride springs from the table,
and says, Give the fiddlers a trifle, and let them go. This explains
the last stanza of English <b>A</b> (cf., Norwegian <b>B</b> 21):</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now pay the miller for his payne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let him bee gone in the divel's name.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Swedish <b>F</b> has an entirely perverted and feeble conclusion. "A
good man" takes the younger sister from the water, carries her to his
house, revives her, and nurses her till the morrow, and then restores
her to her father, who asks why she is so pale, and why she had not
come back with her sister. She explains that she had been pushed into
the water, "and we may thank this good man that I came home at all."
The father tells the elder that she is a disgrace to her country, and
condemns her to the "blue tower." But her sister intercedes, and a
cheerful and handsome wedding follows.</p>

<p>Swedish <b>C</b> and nearly all the Norwegian ballads<a name="FNanchor_1_138" id="FNanchor_1_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> restore the
drowned girl to life, but not by those processes of the Humane Society
which are successfully adopted by the "arlig man" in Swedish <b>F</b>.
The harp is dashed against a stone, or upon the floor, and the girl
stands forth "as good as ever." As Landstad conceives the matter (484,
note 7), the elder sister is a witch, and is in the end burned <i>as
such</i>. The white body of the younger is made to take on the appearance
of a crooked log, which the fishermen (who, by the way, are angels
in <b>C</b>, <b>E</b>) innocently shape into a harp, and the music,
vibrating from her hair "through all her limbs, marrow and bone,"
acts as a disenchantment. However this may be, the restoration of the
younger sister, like all good endings foisted on tragedies, emasculates
the story.</p>

<p>English <b>F</b> 9 has the peculiarity, not noticed elsewhere, that the
drowning girl catches at a broom-root, and the elder sister forces her
to let go her hold.<a name="FNanchor_1_139" id="FNanchor_1_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> In Swedish <b>G</b> she is simply said to swim
to an alder-root. In English <b>G</b> 8 the elder drives the younger
from the land with a switch, in <b>I</b> 8 pushes her off with a silver
wand.</p>

<p>English <b>O</b> introduces the <i>ghost</i> of the drowned sister as
instructing her father's fiddler to make a string of her hair and a
peg of her little finger bone, which done, the first spring the fiddle
plays, it says,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Ye'll drown my sister as she's dune me.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><b>P</b>, which is disordered at the end, seems to have agreed with
<b>O</b>. In <b>Q</b> the ghost sends, by the medium of the miller
and his daughter, respects to father, mother, and true-love, adding
a lock of yellow hair for the last. The ghost is found in <b>N</b>,
Pinkerton's copy, as well, but there appears to the lover at dead of
night, two days after the drowning. It informs him of the murder,
and he makes search for the body. This is a wide departure from the
original story, and plainly a modern perversion. Another variation,
entirely wanting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-124" id="Pg_1-124">[Pg 124]</a></span> in ancient authority, appears in <b>R</b>, <b>S</b>.
The girl is not dead when she has floated down to the mill-dam, and,
being drawn out of the water by the miller, offers him a handsome
reward to take her back to her father [<b>S</b>, to throw her in
again!]. The miller takes the reward, and pushes the girl in again, for
which he is hanged.<a name="FNanchor_1_140" id="FNanchor_1_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p><b>Q</b> has a burden partly Gaelic,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">... ohone and aree (alack and O Lord),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the banks of the Banna (White River), ohone and aree,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>which may raise a question whether the Scotch burden Binnorie
(pronounced Bínnorie, as well as Binnórie) is corrupted from it, or
the corruption is on the other side. Mr Campbell notices as quaint the
reply in stanza 9:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'I did not put you in with the design<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just for to pull you out again.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We have had a similar reply, made under like circumstances, in Polish
versions of No 4: see <a href="#Pg_1-40">p. 40</a>, <a href="#Footnote_1_60">note</a>.</p>

<p>All the Norse versions of this ballad are in two-line stanzas, and all
the English, except <b>L b</b> and in part <b>L a</b>.</p>

<p>Some of the traits of the English and Norse story are presented by an
Esthonian ballad, 'The Harp,' Neus, Ehstnische Volkslieder, No 13, p.
56. Another version is given in Rosenplänter's Beiträge zur genauern
Kenntniss der ehstnischen Sprache, Heft 4, 142, and a third, says Neus,
in Ch. H. J. Schlegel's Reisen in mehrere russische Gouvernements,
<span class="smcap">V</span>, 140. A young woman, who tells her own story, is murdered by
her sisters-in-law and buried in a moor. She comes up as a birch, from
which, with the jaw-bone of a salmon, the teeth of a pike, and her own
hair (the account is somewhat confused) a harp is made. The harp is
taken to the hall by the murdered girl's brother, and responds to his
playing with tones of sorrow like those of the bride who leaves father
and mother for the house of a husband.<a name="FNanchor_1_141" id="FNanchor_1_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>A Slovak ballad often translated (Talvj, Historical View, etc., p. 392;
Wenzig's Slawische Volkslieder, p. 110, Westslawischer Märchenschatz,
273, and Bibliothek Slavischer Poesien, p. 134; Lewestam, Polnische
Volksagen und Märchen, p. 151) comes nearer in some respects. A
daughter is cursed by her mother for not succeeding in drawing water
in frosty weather. Her bucket turns to stone, but she to a maple. Two
fiddlers come by, and, seeing a remarkably fine tree, propose to make
of it fiddles and fiddle-sticks. When they cut into the tree, blood
spirts out. The tree bids them go on, and when they have done, play
before the mother's door, and sing, Here is your daughter, that you
cursed to stone. At the first notes the mother runs to the window,
and begs them to desist, for she has suffered much since she lost her
daughter.</p>

<p>The soul of a dead girl speaks through a tree, again, in a Lithuanian
ballad, Nesselmann, Littauische Volkslieder, No 378, p. 320. The
girl is drowned while attempting to cross a stream, carried down to
the sea, and finally thrown ashore, where she grows up a linden. Her
brother makes a pipe from a branch, and the pipe gives out sweet, sad
tones. The mother says, That tone comes not from the linden; it is thy
sister's soul, that hovers over the water. A like idea is met with
in another Lithuanian ballad, Rhesa, Dainos, ed. Kurschat, No 85, p.
231. A sister plucks a bud from a rose-bush growing over the grave of
her brother, who had died from disappointed love. How fragrant! she
exclaims. But her mother answers, with tears, It is not the rosebud,
but the soul of the youth that died of grief.</p>

<p>Though the range of the ballad proper is somewhat limited, popular
tales equivalent as to the characteristic circumstances are very widely
diffused.</p>

<p>A Polish popular tale, which is, indeed, half song, Wojcicki, Klechdy,
ed. 1851, <span class="smcap">II</span>, 15 (Lewestam, p. 105), Kolberg, Pie&#347;ni ludu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-125" id="Pg_1-125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
Polskiego, p. 292, No 40 <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, <b>c</b>, approaches
very close to the English-Norse ballad. There were three sisters,
all pretty, but the youngest far surpassing the others. A young man
from the far-off Ukraine fell in with them while they were making
garlands. The youngest pleased him best, and he chose her for his
wife. This excited the jealousy of the eldest, and a few days after,
when they were gathering berries in a wood, she killed the youngest,
notwithstanding the resistance of the second sister, buried her, and
gave out that she had been torn to pieces by wolves. When the youth
came to ask after his love, the murderess told him this tale, and so
won him by her devoted consolations that he offered her his hand. A
willow grew out of the grave of the youngest, and a herdsman made a
pipe from one of its boughs. Blow as he would, he could get no sound
from the pipe but this:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Blow on, herdsman, blow! God shall bless thee so.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The eldest was my slayer, the second tried to stay her.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The herdsman took the pipe to the house of the murdered girl. The
mother, the father, and the second sister successively tried it, and
the pipe always sang a like song, Blow, mother, blow, etc. The father
then put the pipe into the eldest sister's hands. She had hardly
touched it, when blood spattered her cheeks, and the pipe sang:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Blow on, sister, blow: God shall wreak me now.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou, sister, 't was didst slay me, the younger tried to stay thee,' etc.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The murderess was torn by wild horses.</p>

<p>Professor Bugge reports a Norwegian tale, Grundtvig, <span class="smcap">III</span>, 878,
which resembles the ballad at the beginning. There were in a family
two daughters and a son. One sister was wasteful, the other saving.
The second complained of the first to her parents, and was killed and
buried by the other. Foliage covered the grave, so that it could not be
seen, but on the trees under which the body lay, there grew "strings."
These the brother cut off and adapted to his fiddle, and when he
played, the fiddle said, My sister is killed. The father, having heard
the fiddle's revelation, brought his daughter to confess her act.</p>

<p>There is a series of tales which represent a king, or other personage,
as being afflicted with a severe malady, and as promising that
whichever of his children, commonly three sons, should bring him
something necessary for his cure or comfort should be his heir: (1)
'La Flor del Lililá,' Fernan Caballero, Lágrimas, cap. 4; (2) 'La caña
del riu de arenas,' Milá, Observaciones sobre la poesia popular, p.
178, No 3; (3) 'Es kommt doch einmal an den Tag,' Müllenhof, Sagen,
u. s. w., p. 495, No 49; (4) 'Vom singenden Dudelsack,' Gonzenbach,
Sicilianische Märchen, <span class="smcap">I</span>, 329, No 51. Or the inheritance is
promised to whichever of the children finds something lost, or rich
and rare, a griffin's feather, a golden branch, a flower: (5) 'Die
Greifenfeder,' Schneller, Märchen und Sagen aus Wälschtirol, p. 143, No
51; (6) 'La Flanuto,' Bladé, Contes et proverbes populaires recueillis
en Armagnac, p. 3, No 1; (7) Wackernagel, in Haupt's Zeitschrift,
<span class="smcap">III</span>, 35, No 3, == 'Das Todtebeindli,' Colshorn, C. u. Th.,
Märchen u. Sagen, p. 193, No 71, == Sutermeister, Kinder-u.-Hausmärchen
aus der Schweiz, p. 119, No 39. Or a king promises his daughter to
the man who shall capture a dangerous wild beast, and the exploit is
undertaken by three brothers [or two]: (8) 'Der singende Knochen,'
Grimms, K. u. H. märchen, <span class="smcap">I</span>, 149, No 28 (1857); (9) 'Die drei
Brüder,' Curtze, Volksüberlieferungen aus dem Fürstenthum Waldeck, p.
53, No 11; (10) 'Der Rohrstengel,' Haltrich, Deutsche Volksmärchen aus
dem Sachsenlande, u. s. w., p. 225, No 42. With these we may group,
though divergent in some respects, (11) 'Der goldene Apfel,' Toeppen,
Aberglauben aus Masuren, p. 139.<a name="FNanchor_1_142" id="FNanchor_1_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> In all these tales the youngest
child is successful, and is killed, out of envy, by the eldest or by
the two elder. [There are only two children in (6), (7), (8); in (4)
the second is innocent, as in the Polish tale.] Reeds grow over the
spot where the body is buried (1), (2), (10), (11), or an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-126" id="Pg_1-126">[Pg 126]</a></span> elder bush
(3), out of which a herdsman makes a pipe or flute; or a white bone
is found by a herdsman, and he makes a pipe or horn of it (5-9); or a
bag-pipe is made of the bones and skin of the murdered youth (4). The
instrument, whenever it is played, attests the murder.</p>

<p>Among the tales of the South African Bechuana, there is one of a
younger brother, who has been killed by an older, immediately appearing
as a bird, and announcing what has occurred. The bird is twice killed,
and the last time burnt and its ashes scattered to the winds, but still
reappears, and proclaims that his body lies by a spring in the desert.
Grimms, K. u. H. m. <span class="smcap">III</span>, 361. Liebrecht has noted that the
fundamental idea is found in a Chinese drama, 'The Talking Dish,' said
to be based on a popular tale. An innkeeper and his wife kill one of
their guests for his money, and burn the body. The innkeeper collects
the ashes and pounds the bones, and makes a sort of mortar and a dish.
This dish speaks very distinctly, and denounces the murderers. Journal
Asiatique, 1851, 4th Series, vol. 18, p. 523.</p>

<p><i>Jamieson, Popular Ballads and Songs, <span class="smcap">I</span>, 48, says that
he gives his text verbatim as it was taken from the recitation
of the lady in Fifeshire (Mrs Brown), to whom both he and Scott
were so much indebted. That this is not to be understood with
absolute strictness will appear from the variations which are
subjoined. Jamieson adds that he had received another copy from
Mrs Arrott of Aberbrothick, "<span class="antiqua">but as it furnished no readings
by which the text could have been materially improved</span>,"
it was not used. Both Jamieson and Scott substitute the
"<span class="antiqua">Binnorie</span>" burden, "<span class="antiqua">the most common and popular</span>,"
says Scott, for the one given by Mrs Brown, with which Mrs
Arrott's agreed. It may be added that Jamieson's interpolations
are stanzas 20, 21, 27, etc., and not, as he says (<span class="smcap">I</span>,
49), 19, 20, 27, etc. These interpolations also occur as such
in the manuscript.</i></p>

of the Irish bards. Mr Walker, at the same time, favored
the editor with the following note: 'I am indebted to my
departed friend, Miss Brooke, for the foregoing pathetic
fragment. Her account of it was as follows: This song was
transcribed, several years ago, from the memory of an old
woman, who had no recollection of the concluding verses;
probably the beginning may also be lost, as it seems to
commence abruptly.' The first verse and burden of the

<p><i>These fragments were communicated to Notes and Queries, April
3, 1852, by "<span class="antiqua">G. A. C.</span>," who had heard '<span class="antiqua">The Miller's
Melody</span>' sung by an old lady in his childhood, and who
represents himself as probably the last survivor of those who
had enjoyed the privilege of listening to her ballads. We
may, therefore, assign this version to the latter part of the
18th century. The two four-line stanzas were sung to "<span class="antiqua">a
slow, quaint strain</span>." Two others which followed were not
remembered, "<span class="antiqua">but their purport was that the body 'stopped
hard by a miller's mill,' and that this 'miller chanced to come
by,' and took it out of the water 'to make a melodye.'</span>"
G.A.C. goes on to say</i>: "My venerable friend's tune here
became a more lively one, and the time quicker; but I can only
recollect a few of the couplets, and these not correctly nor in
order of sequence, in which the transformation of the lady into
a viol is described."</p></div>

reprint of this book, and of the same edition, in "Facetiæ," etc.,

we may suppose that copies, ostensibly of the same edition, varied as

<p><b>A a</b> was obtained directly from Mrs Brown of Falkland, in 1800,
by Alexander Fraser Tytler. Jamieson says that he gives <b>b</b>
verbatim from the recitation of Mrs Arrott; but it would seem that
this must have been a slip of memory, for the two agree except in half
a dozen words. <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>J</b> are now for the
first time printed. <b>G</b> only was taken down earlier than the
present century.</p>

<p>Aytoun remarks (1858): "This is, perhaps, the most popular of all the
Scottish ballads, being commonly recited and sung even at the present
day." The copy which he gives, <span class="smcap">I</span>, 232, was "taken down from
recitation," but is nevertheless a compound of <b>G</b> and <b>A b</b>,
with a few unimportant variations, proceeding, no doubt, from imperfect
recollection.<a name="FNanchor_1_143" id="FNanchor_1_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> The copy in Dixon's Ancient Poems, Ballads, and
Songs, p. 56, repeated in Bell's volume of the same title, p. 50, is
Gilbert's <b>F</b>. Dixon informs us that the ballad was (in 1846)
still popular amongst the peasantry in the west of England. Cunningham
gives us a piece called 'The Three Ladies of Leithan Ha,' Songs of
Scotland, <span class="smcap">II</span>, 87, which he would fain have us believe that he
did not know he had written himself. "The common copies of this tragic
lyric," he truly says, "differ very much from this; not so much in the
story itself as in the way it is told."</p>

<p>All versions but <b>K</b>, which has pretty nearly lost all point,
agree after the opening stanzas. <b>A-E</b> have three ladies and
only one knight; <b>F</b> has three knights and one lady; <b>G</b>,
<b>I</b>, <b>J</b>, <b>K</b> have three ladies and three knights [lords
in <b>G</b>, "bonny boys" in <b>I</b>, the first line being caught
from 'Sir Hugh.'] Three knights are to no purpose; only one knight
has anything to do. The reason for three ladies is, of course, that
the youngest may be preferred to the others,&mdash;an intention somewhat
obscured in <b>B</b>. The ladies are in colors in <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>,
<b>I</b>, <b>J</b>, and this seems to be the better interpretation in
the case of <b>G</b>, though a strict construction of the language
would rather point to the other. The colors are transferred to the
knights in <b>F</b> because there is only one lady. In <b>K</b> this is
a part of the general depravation of the ballad.</p>

<p>'Rizzardo bello,' Wolf, Volkslieder aus Venetien, No 83, seems to be
the same story, with a change of relations such as we often find in
ballad poetry. Rizzardo is conducting his bride home, and on the way
embraces and kisses her. Her brother witnesses "questo onore," and
thrusts his sword into the happy bridegroom's heart. Rizzardo tells
his bride to come on slowly; he will go before to make preparation. He
begs his mother to open the doors, for his bride is without, and he
is wounded to death. They try to make the bride eat. She says she can
neither eat nor drink: she must put her husband to bed. He gives her a
ring, saying, Your brother has been the death of me; then another ring,
in sign that she is to be wife of two brothers. She answers him as
Guldborg answers Ribold, that she would die rather: "Rather die between
two knives than be wife of two brothers." This ballad was obtained from
a peasant woman of Castagnero. Another version, which unfortunately is
not printed, was sung by a woman at Ostiglia on the Po.</p>

<p>Dr Prior remarks that the offence given by not asking a brother's
assent to his sister's marriage was in ballad-times regarded
as unpardonable. Other cases which show the importance of this
preliminary, and the sometimes fatal consequences of omitting it, are:
'Hr. Peder og Mettelille,' Grundtvig, No 78, <span class="smcap">II</span>, 325, sts 4,
6; 'Jomfruen i Skoven,' Danske Viser, <span class="smcap">III</span>, 99, st. 15; 'Jomfru
Ellensborg og Hr. Olof,' ib., <span class="smcap">III</span>, 316, st. 16; 'Iver Lang og
hans Søster,' ib., <span class="smcap">IV</span>, 87, st. 116; 'Herr Helmer Blaa,' ib.,
<span class="smcap">IV</span>, 251, st. 8; 'Jomfru Giselmaar,' ib., <span class="smcap">IV</span>, 309, st.
13. See Prior's Ancient Danish Ballads, <span class="smcap">III</span>, 112, 232 f, 416.</p>

<p>There is a very common German ballad, 'Graf Friedrich,' in which
a bride receives a mortal wound during the bringing-home, but
accidentally, and from the bridegroom's hand. The marriage train is
going up a hill; the way is narrow; they are crowded; Graf Friedrich's
sword shoots from its sheath and wounds the bride. The bridegroom
is exceedingly dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-143" id="Pg_1-143">[Pg 143]</a></span>tressed; he tries to stop the bleeding with his
shirt; she begs that they may ride slowly. When they reach the house
there is a splendid feast, and everything is set before the bride;
but she can neither eat nor drink, and only wishes to lie down. She
dies in the night. Her father comes in the morning, and, learning
what has happened, runs Graf Friedrich through, then drags his body
at a horse's heels, and buries it in a bog. Three lilies sprang from
the spot, with an inscription announcing that Graf Friedrich was in
heaven, and a voice came from the sky commanding that the body should
be disinterred. The bridegroom was then buried with his bride, and this
act of reparation was attended with other miraculous manifestations.
As the ballads stand now, the kinship of 'Graf Friedrich' with 'The
Cruel Brother' is not close and cannot be insisted on; still an early
connection is not improbable.</p>

<p>The versions of 'Graf Friedrich' are somewhat numerous, and there is a
general agreement as to all essentials. They are: <b>A</b>, a Nuremberg
broadside "of about 1535," which has not been made accessible by a
reprint. <b>B</b>, a Swiss broadside of 1647, without place, "printed
in Seckendorf's Musenalmanach für 1808, p. 19;" Uhland, No 122, p. 277;

<p>A Danish ballad, 'Den saarede Jomfru,' Grundtvig, No 244, <span class="smcap">IV</span>,
474, has this slight resemblance with 'Graf Friedrich:' While a knight
is dancing with a princess, his sword glides from the scabbard and cuts
her hand. To save her partner from blame, she represents to her father
that she had cut herself with her brother's sword. This considerateness
so touches the knight (who is, of course, her equal in rank) that he
offers her his hand. The Danish story is found also in Norwegian and in
Färöe ballads.</p>

<p>The peculiar testament made by the bride in 'The Cruel Brother,' by
which she bequeaths good things to her friends, but ill things to the
author of her death, is highly characteristic of ballad poetry. It
will be found again in 'Lord Ronald,' '<a href="#Ballad_13">Edward</a>,' and their analogues.
Still other ballads with this kind of testament are: 'Frillens Hævn,'
Grundtvig, No 208 <b>C</b>, 16-18, <span class="smcap">IV</span>, 207; a young man,
stabbed by his leman, whom he was about to give up in order to marry,
leaves his lands to his father, his bride-bed to his sister, his gilded
couch to his mother, and his knife to his leman, wishing it in her
body. 'Møen paa Baalet,' Grundtvig, No 109 <b>A</b>, 1821, <span class="smcap">II</span>,
587; Ole, falsely accused by her brother, and condemned to be burned,
gives her mother her silken sark, her sister her shoes, her father her
horse, and her brother her knife, with the same wish. 'Kong Valdemar og
hans Søster,' Grundtvig, No 126, <span class="smcap">III</span>, 97, has a testament in
<b>A-E</b> and <b>I</b>; in <b>I</b>, 14-19 (<span class="smcap">III</span>, 912), Liden
Kirsten bequeaths her knife, with the same imprecation, to the queen,
who, in the other copies, is her unrelenting foe: so Lillelin to Herr
Adelbrand, Danske Viser, <span class="smcap">III</span>, 386, No 162, 16-18, Kristensen,
<span class="smcap">I</span>, 262, No 100, <b>A</b> 20-23, having been dragged at a
horse's heels in resentment of a taunt. 'Hustru og Mands Moder,'
Grundtvig, No. 84, <span class="smcap">II</span>, 404, has a testament in <b>A</b>,
<b>B</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>H</b>, and in the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-144" id="Pg_1-144">[Pg 144]</a></span> three a bequest of shoes
or sark to a cruel mother-in-law or foster-mother, with the wish that
she may have no peace or much pain in the wearing. 'Catarina de Lió,'
Briz y Candi, Cansons de la Terra, <span class="smcap">I</span>, 209, has been beaten by
her mother-in-law while in a delicate state. When she is at the point
of death, the mother-in-law asks what doctor she will have and what
will she will make. "My will," says Catherine, "will not please you
much. Send back my velvet dress to my father's; my gala dress give my
sister; give my working dress to the maid, my jewels to the Virgin."
"And what will you leave to me?" "What I leave you will not please you
much: my husband to be hanged, my mother-in-law to be quartered, and my
sister-in-law to be burned." 'Le Testament de Marion,' another version
of this story from the south of France, Uchaud, Gard, Poésies pop. de
la France, MS., <span class="smcap">IV</span>, fol. 283, bequeaths "my laces to my sister
Marioun, my prettiest gowns to my sister Jeanneton; to my rascal of a
husband three fine cords, and, if that is not enough (to hang him),
the hem of his shirt." The Portuguese ballad of 'Dona Helena' rather
implies than expresses the imprecation: Braga, C.P. do Archipelago
Açoriano, p. 225, No 15, p. 227, No 16; Almeida-Garrett, <span class="smcap">III</span>,
56; Hartung, <span class="smcap">I</span>, 233-43, No 18. Helena leaves her husband's
house when near childbirth, out of fear of his mother. Her husband, who
does not know her reason, goes after her, and compels her to return on
horseback, though she has just borne a son. The consequences are what
might be expected, and Helena desires to make her shrift and her will.
She leaves one thing to her oldest sister, another to her youngest.
"And your boy?" "To your bitch of a mother, cause of my woes." "Rather
to yours," says the husband, "for I shall have to kill mine" (so Braga;
Garrett differs somewhat). 'Die Frau zur Weissenburg' (<b>A</b>),
Uhland, p. 287, No 123 <b>B</b>, Scherer's Jungbrunnen, p. 94, No 29;
'Das Lied von der Löwenburg' (<b>B</b>), Simrock, p. 65, No 27; 'Hans
Steutlinger' (<b>C</b>), Wunderhorn, <span class="smcap">II</span>, 168 (1857), all one
story, have a bitterly sarcastic testament. A lady instigates her
paramour to kill her husband. The betrayed man is asked to whom he will
leave his children [commit, <b>A</b>, bequeath, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>].
"To God Almighty, for he knows who they are." "Your property?" "To the
poor, for the rich have enough." "Your wife?" "To young Count Frederic,
whom she always liked more than me (<b>A</b>)." "Your castle?" "To the
flames."</p>

<p>In some cases there is no trace of animosity towards the person who has
caused the testator's death; as in 'El testamento de Amelia' (who has
been poisoned by her mother), Milá, Observaciones, p. 103, No 5, Briz
y Saltó, Cansons de la Terra, <span class="smcap">II</span>, 197 (two copies); 'Herren
Båld,' Afzelius, <span class="smcap">I</span>, 76, No 16 (new ed. <span class="smcap">I</span>, 59, No 15);
a Swedish form of 'Frillens Hævn,' Grundtvig, <span class="smcap">IV</span>, 203; 'Renée
le Glaz' and 'Ervoanik Le Lintier,' Luzel, C.P. de la Basse Bretagne,
<span class="smcap">I</span>, 405, 539, 553. There are also simple testaments where there
is no occasion for an ill remembrance, as in 'Ribold og Guldborg,'
Grundtvig, No 82, <b>I</b>, <b>K</b>, <b>L</b>, <b>U</b>, <b>X</b>,
<b>Æ</b>, Kristensen, <span class="smcap">II</span>, No 84 B; 'Pontplancoat;' Luzel,
<span class="smcap">I</span>, 383, 391. And, again, there are parodies of these wills.
Thus the fox makes his will: Grundtvig, Gamle danske Minder, 1854,
'Mikkels Arvegods,' p. 24, and p. 25 a copy from a manuscript three
hundred years old; Kristensen, Jyske Folkeviser, <span class="smcap">II</span>, 324, No
90; 'Reven og Bjönnen,' 'Reven og Nils fiskar,' Landstad, Nos 85, 86,
p. 637, 639: and the robin, 'Robin's Tesment,' Buchan, <span class="smcap">I</span>, 273,
Herd's MSS, <span class="smcap">I</span>, 154, and Scottish Songs (1776), <span class="smcap">II</span>,

<p>The title 'Lord Randal' is selected for this ballad because that
name occurs in one of the better versions, and because it has become
familiar through Scott's Minstrelsy. Scott says that the hero was more
generally termed Lord Ronald: but in the versions that have come down
to us this is not so. None of these can be traced back further than a
century. <b>F</b> and <b>D</b> were the earliest published. Jamieson
remarks with respect to <b>G</b> (1814): "An English gentleman, who
had never paid any attention to ballads, nor ever read a collection
of such things, told me that when a child he learnt from a playmate
of his own age, the daughter of a clergyman in Suffolk, the following
imperfect ditty." <b>I</b>, a version current in eastern Massachusetts,
may be carried as far back as any. <b>a</b>, <b>b</b> derive from
Elizabeth Foster, whose parents, both natives of eastern Massachusetts,
settled, after their marriage, in Maine, where she was born in 1789.
Elizabeth Foster's mother is remembered to have sung the ballad, and I
am informed that the daughter must have learned it not long after 1789,
since she was removed in her childhood from Maine to Massachusetts,
and continued there till her death. 'Tiranti' ['Taranti'] may not
improbably be a corruption of Lord Randal.</p>

<p>The copy in Smith's Scottish Minstrel, <span class="smcap">III</span>, 58, is Scott's
altered. The first four stanzas are from the Border Minstrelsy, except
the last line of the fourth, which is from Johnson's Museum. The last
two stanzas are a poor modern invention.</p>

<p>Three stanzas which are found in A. Cunningham's Scottish Songs,
<span class="smcap">I</span>, 286 f, may be given for what they are worth. 'The house
of Marr,' in the first, is not to be accepted on the simple ground of
its appearance in his pages. The second is inserted in his beautified
edition of Scott's ballad, and has its burden accordingly; but there
is, besides this, no internal evidence against the second, and none
against the third.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'O where have you been, Lord Ronald, my son?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O where have you been, my handsome young man?'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'At the house of Marr, mother, so make my bed soon,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I am wearied with hunting, and fain would lie down.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A pot-pourri or quodlibet, reprinted in Wolff's Egeria, p. 53, from a
Veronese broadside of the date 1629, shows that this ballad was popular
in <b>Italy</b> more than 250 years ago; for the last but one of the
fragments which make up the medley happens to be the first three lines
of 'L'Avvelenato,' very nearly as they are sung at the present day, and
these are introduced by a summary of the story:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Io vo' finire con questa <i>d'un amante</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Tradito dall' amata.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh che l'è sì garbata<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A cantarla in ischiera:<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>'Dov' andastu iersera,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Figliuol mio ricco, savio e gentile?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Dov' andastu iersera'?"</i><a name="FNanchor_1_144" id="FNanchor_1_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></span>
</div></div>

<p>The ballad was first recovered in 1865, by Dr G. B. Bolza, who took it
down from the singing of very young girls at Loveno. Since then good
copies have been found at Venice. <b>A</b>, 'L'Avvelenato,' Bolza,
Canzoni popolari comasche, No 49, Sitzungsberichte of the Vienna
Academy (philos. histor. class), <span class="smcap">LIII</span>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-153" id="Pg_1-153">[Pg 153]</a></span> 668, is of seventeen
stanzas, of seven short lines, all of which repeat but two: the 8th and
10th stanzas are imperfect.<a name="FNanchor_1_145" id="FNanchor_1_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> A mother inquires of her son where he
has been. He has been at his mistress's, where he has eaten part of an
eel; the rest was given to a dog, that died in the street. The mother
declares that he has been poisoned. He bids her send for the doctor
to see him, for the curate to shrive him, for the notary to make his
will. He leaves his mother his palace, his brothers his carriage and
horses, his sisters a dowry, his servants a free passage to mass ("la
strada d'andà a messa" == nothing), a hundred and fifty masses for his
soul; for his mistress the gallows to hang her. <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>,
'L'Avvelenato,' Bernoni, Nuovi Canti popolari veneziani, 1874, No 1, p.
5, p. 3, have twelve and eighteen four-line stanzas, the questions and
answers in successive stanzas, and the last three lines of the first
pair repeated respectively throughout.<a name="FNanchor_1_146" id="FNanchor_1_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> <b>B</b>, which is given
as a variant of <b>C</b>, agrees with <b>A</b> as to the agent in the
young man's death. It is his mistress in <b>B</b>, but in <b>C</b> it
is his mother. In both, as in <b>A</b>, he has eaten of an eel. The
head he gave to the dogs, the tail to the cats (<b>C</b>). He leaves
to his stewards (castaldi) his carriages and horses (<b>C</b>); to his
herdsmen his cows and fields; to the maids his chamber furnishings;
to his sister the bare privilege of going to mass (<b>C</b>, as in
<b>A</b>); to his mother [wife, <b>C</b>] the keys of his treasure. "La
forca per picarla" is in <b>B</b> as in <b>A</b> the bequest to his
false love, instead of whom we have his mother in <b>C</b>.</p>

<p>The corresponding <b>German</b> ballad has been known to the English
for two generations through Jamieson's translation. The several
versions, all from oral tradition of this century, show the same
resemblances and differences as the English.</p>

<p><b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, 'Schlangenköchin,' eight stanzas of six lines,
four of which are burden, <b>A</b>, Liederhort, p. 6, No 2<sup>a</sup>,
from the neighborhood of Wilsnack, Brandenburg, <b>B</b>, Peter,
<span class="smcap">I</span>, 187, No 6, from Weidenau, Austrian Silesia, run thus:
Henry tells his mother that he has been at his sweetheart's (but not
a-hunting); has had a speckled fish to eat, part of which was given
to the dog [cat, <b>B</b>], which burst. Henry wishes his father and
mother all blessings, and hell-pains to his love, <b>A</b> 6-8. His
mother, <b>B</b> 8, asks where she shall make his bed: he replies,
In the church-yard. <b>C</b>, 'Grossmutter Schlangenköchin,' first
published in 1802, in Maria's (Clemens Brentano's) romance Godwi,
<span class="smcap">II</span>, 113, afterward in the Wunderhorn, <span class="smcap">I</span>, 19 (ed.
1819, <span class="smcap">I</span>, 20, ed. 1857), has fourteen two-line stanzas, or
seven of four lines, one half burden. The copy in Zuccalmaglio, p.
217, No 104, "from Hesse and North Germany," is the same thing with
another line of burden intercalated and two or three slight changes.
Maria has been at her grandmother's, who gave her a fish to eat which
she had caught in her kitchen garden; the dog ate the leavings, and
his belly burst. The conclusion agrees with <b>B</b>, neither having
the testament. <b>D</b>, 'Stiefmutter,' seven stanzas of four short
lines, two being burden, Uhland, No 120, p. 272; excepting one slight
variation, the same as Liederhort, p. 5, No 2, from the vicinity of
Bückeburg, Lippe-Schaumburg. A child has been at her mother's sister's
house, where she has had a well-peppered broth and a glass of red wine.
The dogs [and cats] had some broth too, and died on the spot. The
child wishes its father a seat in heaven, for its mother one in hell.
<b>E</b>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-154" id="Pg_1-154">[Pg 154]</a></span> 'Kind, wo bist du denn henne west?' Reiffenberg, p. 8, No
4, from Bökendorf, Westphalia, four stanzas of six lines, combining
question and answer, two of the six burden. A child has been at its
step-aunt's, and has had a bit of a fish caught in the nettles along
the wall. The child gives all its goods to its brother, its clothes
to its sister, but three devils to its [step-]mother. <b>F</b>, 'Das
vergiftete kind,' seven four-line stanzas, two burden, Schuster,
Siebenbürgisch-sächsische V. L., p. 62, No 58, from Mühlbach. A child
tells its father that its heart is bursting; it has eaten of a fish,
given it by its mother, which the father declares to be an adder. The
child wishes its father a seat in heaven, its mother one in hell.</p>

<p><b>A</b>, <b>B</b> are nearer to 'Lord Randal,' and have even the
name Henry which we find in English <b>C</b>. <b>C-F</b> are like
<b>J-O</b>, 'The Croodlin Doo.'</p>

<p><b>Dutch.</b> 'Isabelle,' Snellaert, p. 73, No 67, seven four-line
stanzas, the first and fourth lines repeated in each. Isabel has been
sewing at her aunt's, and has eaten of a fish with yellow stripes
that had been caught with tongs in the cellar. The broth, poured into
the street, caused the dogs to burst. She wishes her aunt a red-hot
furnace, herself a spade to bury her, her brother a wife like his
mother.</p>

<p><b>Swedish.</b> <b>A</b>, 'Den lillas Testamente,' ten five-line
stanzas, three lines burden, Afzelius, <span class="smcap">III</span>, 13, No 68;
ed. Bergström, <span class="smcap">I</span>, 291, No 55. A girl, interrogated by her
step-mother, says she has been at her aunt's, and has eaten two wee
striped fishes. The bones she gave the dog; the stanza which should
describe the effect is wanting. She wishes heaven for her father and
mother, a ship for her brother, a jewel-box and chests for her sister,
and hell for her step-mother and her nurse. <b>B</b>, Arwidsson,
<span class="smcap">II</span>, 90, No 88, nine five-line stanzas, two lines burden. In
the first stanza, evidently corrupt, the girl says she has been at her
brother's. She has had eels cooked with pepper, and the bones, given to
the dogs, made them burst. She gives her father good corn in his barns,
her brother and sister a ship, etc., hell to her step-mother and nurse.</p>

<p><b>Danish.</b> Communicated by Prof. Grundtvig, as obtained for the
first time from tradition in 1877; five stanzas of five lines, three
lines repeating. Elselille, in answer to her mother, says she has been
in the meadow, where she got twelve small snakes. She wishes heavenly
joy to her father, a grave to her brother, hell torment to her sister.</p>

<p><b>Magyar.</b> 'Der vergiftete Knabe,' Aigner, Ungarische
Volksdichtungen, 2<sup>e</sup> Auflage, p. 127, in nine six-line stanzas, four
being a burden. Johnnie, in answer to his mother, says he has been
at his sister-in-law's, and has eaten a speckled toad, served on her
handsomest plate, of which he is dying. He bequeaths to his father his
best carriage, to his brothers his finest horses, to his sister his
house furniture, to his sister-in-law everlasting damnation, to his
mother pain and sorrow.</p>

<p><b>Wendish.</b> 'Der vergiftete Knabe,' Haupt u. Schmaler, <span class="smcap">I</span>,
110, No 77, twelve four-line stanzas, combining question and answer,
the first and last line repeating. Henry has been at the neighbor's,
has eaten part of a fish caught in the stable with a dung-fork; his dog
ate the rest, and burst. There is no testament. His mother asks him
where she shall make his bed; he replies, In the churchyard; turn my
head westward, and cover me with green turf.</p>

<p>The numerous forms of this story show a general agreement, with
but little difference except as to the persons who are the object
and the agent of the crime. These are, according to the Italian
tradition,&mdash;which is 250 years old, while no other goes back more
than a hundred years, and far the larger part have been obtained in
recent years,&mdash;a young man and his true-love; and in this account
unite two of the three modern Italian versions, English <b>A-G</b>,
German <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>. Scott suggests that the handsome young
sportsman (whom we find in English <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>,
<b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>H</b>) may have been exchanged for a little
child poisoned by a step-mother, to excite greater interest in the
nursery. This seems very reasonable. What girl with a lover, singing
the ballad, would not be tempted to put off the treacherous act on
so popular, though most unjustly popular, an object of aversion? A
mother, again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-155" id="Pg_1-155">[Pg 155]</a></span> would scarcely allow "mother" to stand, as is the case
in Italian <b>C</b> and German <b>F</b>, and a singer who considered
that all blood relations should be treated as sacred would ascribe
the wickedness to somebody beyond that pale, say a neighbor, as the
Wendish ballad does, and Zuccalmaglio's reading of German <b>C</b>.
The step-mother is expressly named only in English <b>J</b>, <b>K
c</b>, <b>L</b>, <b>M</b>, <b>N</b>, <b>O</b>, and in four of these,
<b>J</b>, <b>K c</b>, <b>M</b>, <b>O</b>, the child has a mammie,<a name="FNanchor_1_147" id="FNanchor_1_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>
which certainly proves an <i>alibi</i> for the step-mother, and confirms
what Scott says. There is a step-aunt in German <b>E</b> and Swedish
<b>A</b>, and the aunt in German <b>D</b> and the Dutch ballad, and the
grandmother in English <b>I</b>, <b>K a</b>, <b>b</b>, German <b>C</b>,
are perhaps meant (as the brother in Swedish <b>B</b> certainly is) to
be step-relations and accommodating instruments.</p>

<p>The poisoning is shifted to a wife in English <b>H</b>, to an uncle in
English <b>I d</b>, and to a sister-in-law in the Magyar version.</p>

<p>There is all but universal consent that the poisoning was done by
serving up snakes for fish. The Magyar says a toad, English <b>M</b>
a four-footed fish,<a name="FNanchor_1_148" id="FNanchor_1_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> German <b>D</b> a well-peppered broth and a
glass of red wine. English <b>L</b> adds a drink of hemlock stocks to
the speckled trout; <b>F</b>, <b>H</b> have simply poison. The fish are
distinctively eels in the Italian versions, and in English <b>A</b>,
<b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>I</b>, Swedish <b>B</b>. English
<b>A</b>, <b>J</b>, <b>K</b>, <b>M</b>, <b>N</b>, <b>O</b>, German
<b>A-D</b>, the Italian, Swedish, Dutch, Wendish versions, and by
implication English <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b> also, concur in saying
that a part of the fish was given to a dog [dogs, cat, cats], and that
death was the consequence. Bursting or swelling is characteristic of
this kind of poisoning: German <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>F</b>,
English <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, and the Dutch and Wendish versions.</p>

<p>The dying youth or child in many cases makes a nuncupative will, or
declares his last wishes, upon a suggestion proceeding from the person
who is by him, commonly from the mother: English <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>,
<b>C</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>I</b>: German <b>A</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>,
<b>F</b>: the Italian, Dutch, Swedish, Danish, Magyar versions. The
bequest to the poisoner is the gallows in English <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>,
<b>H</b>, <b>I</b>, Italian <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>; hell, English
<b>A</b>, German <b>A</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>F</b>, Swedish <b>A</b>,
<b>B</b>, Danish; and an equivalent in German <b>E</b>, the Dutch and
the Magyar copy. 'The Cruel Brother,' No 11, and 'Edward,' No 13, have
a will of this same fashion.</p>

<p>In all the English versions the burden has the entreaty "Make my bed,"
and this is addressed to the mother in all but <b>L</b>, <b>N</b>. In
<b>H</b>, an Irish copy, and <b>I</b>, an American one, the mother asks
where the bed shall be made; and the answer is, In the churchyard. This
feature is found again in German <b>B</b>, <b>C</b> and in the Wendish
version.</p>

<p>The resemblance in the form of the stanza in all the versions deserves
a word of remark. For the most part, the narrative proceeds in sections
of two short lines, or rather half lines, which are a question and
an answer, the rest of the stanza being regularly repeated. English
<b>L</b>, <b>N</b>, as written (<b>L</b> not always), separate the
question and answer; this is done, too, in Italian <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>.
German <b>E</b>, on the contrary, has two questions and the answers in
each stanza, and is altogether peculiar. Swedish <b>B</b> varies the
burden in part, imagining father, brother, sister, etc., to ask what
the little girl will give to each, and adapting the reply accordingly,
"Faderen min," "Broderen min."</p>

<p>A Bohemian and a Catalan ballad which have two of the three principal
traits of the foregoing, the poisoning and the testament, do not
exhibit, perhaps have lost, the third, the employment of snakes.</p>

<p>The story of the first is that a mother who dislikes the wife her son
has chosen attempts to poison her at the wedding feast. She sets a
glass of honey before the son, a glass of poison before the bride.
They exchange cups. The poison is swift. The young man leaves four
horses to his brother, eight cows to his sister, his fine house to his
wife. "And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-156" id="Pg_1-156">[Pg 156]</a></span> what to me, my son?" asks the mother. A broad mill-stone
and the deep Moldau is the bequest to her. Waldau, Böhmische Granaten,
<span class="smcap">II</span>, 109, cited by Reifferscheid, p. 137 f.</p>

<p>The Catalan ballad seems to have been softened at the end. Here again
a mother hates her daughter-in-law. She comes to the sick woman, "com
qui no 'n sabès res," and asks What is the matter? The daughter says,
You have poisoned me. The mother exhorts her to confess and receive
the sacrament, and then make her will. She gives her castles in France
to the poor and the pilgrims [and the friars], and to her brother
Don Carlos [who, in one version is her husband]. Two of the versions
remember the Virgin. "And to me?" "To you, my husband [my cloak,
rosary], that when you go to mass you may remember me." In one version
the mother asks the dying woman where she will be buried. She says At
Saint Mary's. Milà, Observaciones, p. 103 f, No 5, two versions: Briz
y Saltó, <span class="smcap">II</span>, 197 f, two also, the first nearly the same as
Milà's first.</p>

<p>Poisoning by giving a snake as food, or by infusing the venom in drink,
is an incident in several other popular ballads.</p>

<p>Donna Lombarda attempts, at the instigation of a lover, to rid herself
of her husband by pounding a serpent, or its head, in a mortar, and
mixing the juice with his wine [in one version simply killing the
snake and putting it in a cask]: Nigra, Canzoni del Piemonti, in
Rivista Contemporanea, <span class="smcap">XII</span>, 32 ff, four versions; Marcoaldi,
p. 177, No 20; Wolf, Volkslieder aus Venetien, p. 46, No 72; Righi,
Canti popolari veronesi, p. 37, No 100*; Ferraro, C. p. monferrini,
p. 1, No 1; Bernoni, C. p. veneziani, Puntata <span class="smcap">V</span>, No 1. In
three of Nigra's versions and in Ferraro's the drink is offered when
the husband returns from hunting. The husband, rendered suspicious
by the look of the wine, or warned of his danger, forces his wife to
drink first. So in a northern ballad, a mother who attempts to destroy
her sons [step-sons] with a brewage of this description is obliged
to drink first, and bursts with the poison: 'Eiturbyrlunar kvæði,'
Íslenzk Fornkv., <span class="smcap">II</span>, 79, No 43 A; 'Fru Gundela,' Arwidsson,
<span class="smcap">II</span>, 92, No 89; 'Signelill aa hennes synir,' Bugge, p. 95, No
<span class="smcap">XX</span>, the last half.</p>

<p>In one of the commonest Slavic ballads, a girl, who finds her brother
an obstacle to her desires, poisons him, at the instigation and under
the instruction of the man she fancies, or of her own motion, by giving
him a snake to eat, or the virus in drink. The object of her passion,
on being informed of what she has done, casts her off, for fear of
her doing the like to him. Bohemian: 'Sestra travi&#269;ka,' Erben, P.

<p>A version given by De Rada, Rapsodie d'un poema albanese, p. 78, canto
x, resembles the Slavic, with a touch of the Italian. A man incites a
girl to poison her brother by pounding the poison out of a serpent's
head and tail and mixing it with wine.</p>

<p>In a widely spread Romaic ballad, a mother poisons the bride whom
her son has just brought home,&mdash;an orphan girl in some versions, but
in one a king's daughter wedding a king's son. The cooks who are
preparing the feast are made to cook for the bride the heads of three
snakes [nine snakes' heads, a three-headed snake, winged snakes and
two-headed adders]. In two Epirote versions the poisoned girl bursts
with the effects. "<a title="[Greek: Ta kaka petherika]">&#932;&#945; &#954;&#945;&#954;&#945; &#961;&#949;&#952;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#954;&#945;</a>," Passow, p. 335,

<p>An Italian mother-in-law undertakes to poison her son's wife with
a snake-potion. The wife, on her husband's return from the chase,
innocently proposes to share the drink with him. Her husband no sooner
has tasted than he falls dead. (Kaden, Italien's Wunderhorn, p. 85).</p>

<p>Scott cites in his preface to 'Lord Randal' a passage from a MS.
chronicle of England, in which the death of King John is described as
being brought about by administering to him the venom of a toad (cf.
the Magyar ballad). The symptoms&mdash;swelling and rupture&mdash;are found in
the Scandinavian and Epirote ballads referred to above, besides those
previously noticed (p. 155). King John had asked a monk at the abbey
of Swinshed how much a loaf on the table was worth. The monk answered
a half-penny. The king said that if he could bring it about, such a
loaf should be worth twenty pence ere half a year. The monk thought
he would rather die than that this should come to pass. "And anon the
monk went unto his abbot and was shrived of him, and told the abbot
all that the king said, and prayed his abbot to assoil him, for he
would give the king such a wassail that all England should be glad and
joyful thereof. Then went the monk into a garden, and found a toad
therein, and took her up, and put her in a cup, and filled it with good
ale, and pricked her in every place, in the cup, till the venom came
out in every place, and brought it before the king, and kneeled, and
said: 'Sir, wassail: for never in your life drank ye of such a cup.'
'Begin, monk,' said the king: and the monk drank a great draught, and
took the king the cup, and the king also drank a great draught, and
set down the cup. The monk anon went to the firmary, and there died
anon, on whose soul God have mercy, amen. And five monks sing for his
soul especially, and shall while the abbey standeth. The king was anon
full evil at ease, and commanded to remove the table, and asked after
the monk; and men told him that he was dead, for his womb was broke in
sunder. When the king heard this tiding, he commanded for to truss: but
all it was for nought, for his belly began to swell from the drink that
he drank, that he died within two days, the morrow after Saint Luke's
day." Minstrelsy, <span class="smcap">III</span>, 287 f. The same story in Eulogium
Historiarum, ed. Haydon, <span class="smcap">III</span>, 109 f.</p>

<h2><a name="Ballad_13" id="Ballad_13">13</a>
<br />
EDWARD</h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><b><a href="#Version_13_A">A</a>. a.</b> Motherwell's MS., p. 139. <b>b.</b> Motherwell's
Minstrelsy, p. 339. From recitation.</p>

<p><b><a href="#Version_13_B">B</a>.</b> Percy's Reliques, 1765, <span class="smcap">I</span>, 53. Communicated
by Sir David Dalrymple.</p>

<p><b><a href="#Version_13_C">C</a>.</b> MS. of A. Laing, one stanza.</p></div>


<p><b>A b</b>, "given from the recitation of an old woman," is evidently
<b>A a</b> slightly regulated by Motherwell. <b>B</b>, we are informed
in the 4th edition of the Reliques, p. 61, was sent Percy by Sir David
Dalrymple, Lord Hailes. Motherwell thought there was reason to believe
"that his lordship made a few slight verbal improvements on the copy
he transmitted, and altered the hero's name to Edward,&mdash;a name which,
by the bye, never occurs in a Scottish ballad, except where allusion
is made to an English king."<a name="FNanchor_1_150" id="FNanchor_1_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> Dalrymple, at least, would not
be likely to change a Scotch for an English name. The Bishop might
doubtless prefer Edward to Wat, or Jock, or even Davie. But as there
is no evidence that any change of name was made, the point need not be
discussed. As for other changes, the word "brand," in the first stanza,
is possibly more literary than popular; further than this the language
is entirely fit. The affectedly antique spelling<a name="FNanchor_1_151" id="FNanchor_1_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> in Percy's copy
has given rise to vague suspicions concerning the authenticity of
the ballad, or of the language: but as spelling will not make an old
ballad, so it will not unmake one. We have, but do not need, the later
traditional copy to prove the other genuine. 'Edward' is not only
unimpeachable, but has ever been regarded as one of the noblest and
most sterling specimens of the popular ballad.</p>

<p>Motherwell seems to incline to regard 'Edward' rather as a detached
portion of a ballad than as complete in itself. "The verses of
which it consists," he says, "generally conclude the ballad of 'The
Twa Brothers,' and also some versions of 'Lizie Wan:'" Minstrelsy,
<span class="smcap">LXVII</span>, 12. The Finnish parallel which Motherwell refers to,
might have convinced him that the ballad is complete as it is; and he
knew as well as anybody that one ballad is often appended to another by
reciters, to lengthen the story or improve the conclusion.<a name="FNanchor_1_152" id="FNanchor_1_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> More or
less of 'Edward' will be found in four versions of '<a href="#Ballad_49">The Twa Brothers</a>'
and two of '<a href="#Ballad_51">Lizie Wan</a>,' further on in this volume.</p>

<p>This ballad has been familiarly known to have an exact counterpart
in <b>Swedish</b>. There are four versions, differing only as to
length: 'Sven i Rosengård,' <b>A</b>, Afzelius, No 67, <span class="smcap">III</span>,
4, eleven two-line stanzas, with three more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-168" id="Pg_1-168">[Pg 168]</a></span> lines of burden;
<b>B</b>, <span class="smcap">III</span>, 3, six stanzas (Bergström's ed., No 54, 1,
2); <b>C</b>, Arwidsson, No 87 <b>A</b>, <span class="smcap">II</span>, 83, eighteen
stanzas; <b>D</b>, No 87 B, <span class="smcap">II</span>, 86, sixteen stanzas. The same
in <b>Danish</b>: <b>A</b>, Grundtvig, Engelske og skotske Folkeviser,
p. 175, nine stanzas; <b>B</b>, Boisen, Nye og gamle Viser, 10th ed.,
No 95, p. 185, 'Brodermordet.' And in <b>Finnish</b>, probably derived
from the Swedish, but with traits of its own: <b>A</b>, Schröter's
Finnische Runen, p. 124, 'Werinen Pojka,' The Bloodstained Son, fifteen
two-line stanzas, with two lines of refrain; <b>B</b>, 'Velisurmaaja,'
Brother-Murderer, Kanteletar, p. x, twenty stanzas.</p>

<p>All these are a dialogue between mother and son, with a question and
answer in each stanza. The mother asks, Where have you been? The
son replies that he has been in the stable [Danish, grove, fields;
Finnish <b>A</b>, on the sea-strand]. "How is it that your foot is
bloody?"<a name="FNanchor_1_153" id="FNanchor_1_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> [clothes, shirt; Finnish, "How came your jerkin muddy?"
etc.] A horse has kicked or trod on him. "How came your sword so
bloody?" He then confesses that he has killed his brother. [Swedish
<b>D</b> and the Danish copies have no question about the foot, etc.]
Then follows a series of questions as to what the son will do with
himself, and what shall become of his wife, children, etc., which are
answered much as in the English ballad. Finally, in all, the mother
asks when he will come back, and he replies (with some variations),
When crows are white. And that will be? When swans are black. And
that? When stones float. And that? When feathers sink, etc. This last
feature, stupidly exaggerated in some copies, and even approaching
burlesque, is one of the commonplaces of ballad poetry, and may or may
not have been, from the beginning, a part of the ballads in which it
occurs. Such a conclusion could not be made to adhere to 'Edward,' the
last stanza of which is peculiar in implicating the mother in the guilt
of the murder. Several versions of 'The Twa Brothers' preserve this
trait, and 'Lizie Wan' also.</p>

<p>The stanza of this ballad was originally, in all probability, one of
two lines&mdash;a question and an answer&mdash;with refrains, as we find it
in <b>A</b> 10, 11, 12, and the corresponding Swedish and Finnish
ballad; and in 'Lord Randal,' <b>J</b>, <b>K</b>, etc., and also the
corresponding Swedish and German ballad. <b>A</b> 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9
are now essentially stanzas of one line, with refrains; that is, the
story advances in these at that rate. <b>A</b> 4, 7 (== <b>C</b>) are
entirely irregular, substituting narrative or descriptive circumstances
for the last line of the refrain, and so far forth departing from
primitive simplicity.<a name="FNanchor_1_154" id="FNanchor_1_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> The stanza in <b>B</b> embraces always
a question and a reply, but for what is refrain in other forms of

<p><b>B a</b> is from tradition of the latter half of the eighteenth
century; the other copies from the earlier part of this.</p>

<p>Three sisters go out (together, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>,
successively, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>) to gather flowers (<b>A</b>,
<b>B</b>, <b>E</b>). A banished man (outlyer bold, <b>D</b>, Loudon
lord, <b>E</b>) starts up from a hiding-place, and offers them one
after the other the choice of being his wife or dying by his hand.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="linenum">(<b>A.</b>)</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">'It's whether will ye be a rank robber's wife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or will ye die by my wee penknife?'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="linenum">(<b>D.</b>)</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Wiltow twinn with thy maidenhead, or thy sweet life?'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The first and the second express a simple preference for death, and
are killed and laid by, "to bear the red rose company" (<b>A</b>).
The youngest, in <b>A</b>, says she has a brother in the wood, who
will kill him if he kills her. The outlaw asks the brother's name,
finds that he himself is the man, and takes his own life with the same
weapon that had shed the blood of his sisters. <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>,
<b>D</b> have three brothers, the youngest of whom is the banished
lord (<b>C</b>), the outlyer bold (<b>D</b>). The story is defective
in <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>. In <b>D</b> the outlaw, on finding what he has
done, takes a long race, and falls on his knife. The conclusion of
<b>E</b> is not so finely tragic. A brother John comes riding by just
as the robber is about to kill the third sister, apprehends him by the
agency of his three pages, and reserves him to be hanged on a tree,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Or thrown into the poisond lake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To feed the toads and rattle-snake.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>According to the account given by Herd, and repeated by Jamieson, the
story of the lost conclusion of <b>B</b> made the banished man discover
that he had killed his two brothers as well as his two sisters.</p>

<p>This ballad, with additional circumstances, is familiar to all branches
of the Scandinavian race.</p>

<p><b>Danish.</b> There are many versions from oral tradition, as yet
unprinted, besides these two: <b>A</b>, 'Hr. Truels's Døttre,' Danske
Viser, <span class="smcap">III</span>, 392, No 164, there reprinted from Sandvig,
Beskrivelse over Øen Møen, 1776: <b>B</b>, 'Herr Thors Børn,' from
recent tradition of North Sleswig, Berggreen, Danske Folke-Sange, 3d
ed., p. 88, No 42.</p>

<p><b>A.</b> Herr Truels' three daughters oversleep their matins one
morning, and are roused by their mother. If we have overslept our
matins, they say, we will make up at high mass. They set out for
church, and in a wood fall in with three robbers, who say:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Whether will ye be three robbers' wives,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or will ye rather lose your lives?'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Much rather death, say they. The two elder sisters submitted to their
fate without a word; the third made a hard resistance. With her last
breath she adjured the robbers to seek a lodging at Herr Truels' that
night. This they did. They drank so long that they drank Herr Truels
to bed. Then they asked his wife to promise herself to all three.
First, she said, she must look into their bags. In their bags she saw
her daughters' trinkets. She excused herself for a moment, barred
the door strongly, roused her husband, and made it known to him that
these guests had killed his three daughters. Herr Truels called on
all his men to arm. He asked the robbers who was their father. They
said that they had been stolen by robbers, on their way to school,
one day; had had a hard life for fourteen years; and the first crime
they had committed was killing three maids yesterday. Herr Truels
revealed to them that they had murdered their sisters, and offered
them new clothes, in which they might go away. "Nay," they said, "not
so; life for life is meet." They were taken out of the town, and their
heads struck off. <b>B</b> differs from <b>A</b> in only a few points.
The robbers ask lodging at Herr Thor's, as being pilgrims. When he
discovers their true character, he threatens them with the wheel. They
say, Shall we come to the wheel? Our father drinks Yule with the king.
They tell him their story, and their father offers them saddle and
horse to make their best way off. They reply, "We will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-172" id="Pg_1-172">[Pg 172]</a></span> give blood for
blood," spread their cloaks on the floor, and let their blood run.</p>

<p><b>A.</b> Herr Töres' daughters overslept matins, dressed themselves
handsomely, and set off for mass. All on the heath they were met by
three wood-robbers, who demanded, Will ye be our wives, or lose your
lives? The first answered: God save us from trying either! the second,
Rather let us range the world! the third, Better death with honor! But</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">First were they the three wood-robbers' wives,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And after that they lost their young lives.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The robbers strip them; then go and ask to be taken in by Herr Töres.
He serves them with mead and wine, but presently begins to wish his
daughters were at home. His wife sees him to bed; then returns to her
guests, who offer her a silken sark to pass the night with them. "Give
me a sight of the silken sark," she cries, with prophetic soul: "God
have mercy on my daughters!" She rouses her husband, and tells him
that the robbers have slain his bairns. He puts on his armor and kills
two of them: the third begs to be spared till he can say who were his
kin; his father's name is Töres! Father and mother resolve to build a
church for penance, and it shall be called Kerna. <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>,
<b>D</b>. The girls meet three "vallare," strolling men, and none of
them good (<b>C</b>). The robbers cut off the girls' heads on the
trunk of a birch (cf. English <b>C</b> 5: "It's lean your head upon my
staff," and with his pen-knife he has cutted it aff): three springs
burst forth immediately. They go to the house, and ask the mother if
she will buy silken sarks that nine maids have stitched (<b>B</b>). She
says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Open your sacks, and let me see:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mayhap I shall know them all three.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The father, in <b>B</b>, when he discovers that he has slain his own
sons, goes to the smith, and has an iron band fastened round his
middle. The parents vow to build a church as an expiation, and it shall
be called Kerna (<b>B</b>, <b>C</b>).</p>

Icelandic versions which follow, the robbers are not the brothers of
the maids. Torkild's two daughters sleep till the sun shines on their
beds. Their father wakens them, and tells Katrine she is waited for at
church. Katrine dresses herself splendidly, but does not disdain to
saddle her own horse.</p>

<p>First she came upon three strollers (vadlarar<a name="FNanchor_1_156" id="FNanchor_1_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>), then two, then
one, and the last asked her whether she would pass the night with him
(vera qvöldar vujv) or die. He cut off her head, and wherever her
blood ran a light kindled; where her head fell a spring welled forth:
where her body lay a church was [afterwards] built. The rover came to
Torkild's house, and the father asked if he had seen Katrine. He said
she had been at Mary kirk the day before, and asked for a lodging,
feigning to be sick. This was readily granted. He went to bed, and
Aasa, the other sister, waited upon him. He offered her a silken sark
to sleep with him. Aasa asked to see the sark first, and found on it
her sister's mark.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-173" id="Pg_1-173">[Pg 173]</a></span> The fellow went on to offer her a blue cloak and
gold crown successively, and on both of these she saw her sister's
mark. Aasa bade him good-night, went to her father, and told him that
the man they had housed had killed his daughter. Torkild ordered his
swains to light a pile in the wood: early the next morning they burned
the murderer on it.</p>

<p><b>Icelandic.</b> Five Icelandic versions, and the first stanza of
two more, are given in Íslenzk Fornkvæði, <span class="smcap">I</span>, 108 ff, No 15,
'Vallara kvæði.'</p>

<p>The story is nearly the same as in the Färöe ballad. Two of Thorkell's
daughters sleep till after the sun is up (<b>B</b>, <b>C</b>). They
wash and dress; they set out for church (<b>C</b>). On the heath they
encounter a strolling man, <b>A</b>; a tall, large man, <b>C</b>,
<b>E</b>; a horseman or knight, <b>D</b>. He greets them: "Why will
ye not speak? Are ye come of elves, or of kings themselves?" <b>A</b>
[Are ye come of earls, or of beggar-churls? <b>B</b>]. They answer,
We are not come of elves, nor of kings themselves; we are Thorkell's
daughters, and serve Mary kirk. He asks, Will ye choose to lose your
life, or shall I rather take you to wife? The choice, they say, is
hard: they would rather die. He kills them and buries them. At night
he goes to Thorkell's house, where Asa is alone. He knocks to be let
in; Asa refuses; he draws the latch with his deft fingers (<b>A</b>,
<b>C</b>, <b>D</b>). He offers Asa a silken sark to sleep with him [and
a blue cloak to say nothing, <b>A</b>]. She asked to see the sark,
and knew her sisters' work, begged him to wait a moment, went to her
father, and told him that the murderer of his daughters was there.
Thorkell dashed his harp to the floor [and kicked over the table,
<b>D</b>, <b>E</b>]. The murderer in the morning was hanged like a dog,
<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>. [Thorkell tore at his hair and cut him down with an
elder-stock, <b>C</b>; they fought three days, and on the fourth the
villain was hanged in a strap, <b>E</b>, the knight was hanging like
a dog, <b>D</b>]. A miraculous light burned over the place where the
maids had been buried, <b>A</b> 16, <b>C</b> 27, <b>D</b> 24, <b>E</b>
12. When their bodies were taken into the church, the bells rang of
themselves, <b>D</b>.</p>

<p><b>Norwegian</b> versions of this ballad have been obtained from
tradition, but none as yet have been published.</p>

<p>"The mains and burn of Fordie, the banks of which are very beautiful,"
says Aytoun (<span class="smcap">I</span>, 159), "lie about six miles to the east
of Dunkeld." Tradition has connected the story with half a dozen
localities in Sweden, and, as Professor Grundtvig informs me, with at
least eight places in the different provinces of Denmark. The Kerna
church of the Swedish ballads, not far from Linköping (Afzelius),
has been popularly supposed to derive its name from a Catharina,
Karin, or Karna, killed by her own brother, a wood-robber, near its
site. See Afzelius, ed. Bergström, <span class="smcap">II</span>, 329 ff: Danske Viser,

LEESOME BRAND</h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><b><a href="#Version_15_A">A</a>.</b> 'Leesome Brand.' <b>a.</b> Buchan's Ballads of the
North of Scotland, <span class="smcap">I</span>, 38. <b>b.</b> Motherwell's MS.,
p. 626.</p>

<p><b><a href="#Version_15_B">B</a>.</b> 'The Broom blooms bonnie,' etc., Motherwell's MS., p.
365.</p></div>


<p>This is one of the cases in which a remarkably fine ballad has been
worse preserved in Scotland than anywhere else. Without light from
abroad we cannot fully understand even so much as we have saved, and
<i>with</i> this light comes a keen regret for what we have lost.</p>

<p><b>A</b>, from Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, is found also
in Motherwell's MS., but without doubt was derived from Buchan. Though
injured by the commixture of foreign elements, <b>A</b> has still much
of the original story. <b>B</b> has, on the contrary, so little that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-178" id="Pg_1-178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
distinctively and exclusively belongs to this story that it might
almost as well have been put with the following ballad, '<a href="#Ballad_16">Sheath and
Knife</a>,' as here. A third ballad, 'The Birth of Robin Hood,' preserves
as much of the story as <b>A</b>, but in an utterly incongruous and
very modern setting, being, like '<a href="#Ballad_8">Erlinton</a>,' <b>C</b>, forced into an
absurd Robin Hood framework.</p>

<p>The mixture of four-line with two-line stanzas in <b>A</b> of course
comes from different ballads having been blended, but for all that,
these ballads might have had the same theme. Stanzas 33-35, however,
are such as we meet with in ballads of the '<a href="#Ballad_7">Earl Brand</a>' class, but
not in those of the class to which 'Leesome Brand' belongs. In the
English ballads, and nearly all the Danish, of the former class, there
is at least a conversation between son and mother [father], whereas
in the other the catastrophe excludes such a possibility. Again, the
"unco land" in the first stanza, "where winds never blew nor cocks
ever crew," is at least a reminiscence of the paradise depicted in
the beginning of many of the versions of 'Ribold and Guldborg,' and
stanza 4 of 'Leesome Brand' closely resembles stanza 2 of '<a href="#Ballad_7">Earl Brand</a>,'
<b>A</b>.<a name="FNanchor_1_157" id="FNanchor_1_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> Still, the first and fourth stanzas suit one ballad as
well as the other, which is not true of 33-35.</p>

<p>The name Leesome Brand may possibly be a corruption of Hildebrand,
as Earl Brand almost certainly is; but a more likely origin is the
Gysellannd of one of the kindred Danish ballads.</p>

<p>The white hind, stanzas 28, 30, is met with in no other ballad of
this class, and, besides this, the last four stanzas are in no kind
of keeping with what goes before, for the "young son" is spoken of as
having been first brought home at some previous period. Grundtvig has
suggested that the hind and the blood came from a lost Scottish ballad
resembling 'The Maid Transformed into a Hind,' D.g.F, No 58. In this
ballad a girl begs her brother, who is going hunting, to spare the
little hind that "plays before his foot." The brother nevertheless
shoots the hind, though not mortally, and sets to work to flay it,
in which process he discovers his sister under the hind's hide. His
sister tells him that she had been successively changed into a pair of
scissors, a sword, a hare, a hind, by her step-mother, and that she was
not to be free of the spell until she had drunk of her brother's blood.
Her brother at once cuts his fingers, gives her some of his blood, and
the girl is permanently restored to her natural shape, and afterwards
is happily married. Stanzas similar to 36-41 of <b>A</b> and 12-16 of
<b>B</b> will be found in the ballad which follows this, to which they
are especially well suited by their riddling character; and I believe
that they belong there, and not here. It is worthy of remark, too, that
there is a <i>hind</i> in another ballad, closely related to No 16 ('The
Bonny Hind'), and that the hind in 'Leesome Brand' may, in some way not
now explicable, have come from this. The confounding of 'Leesome Brand'
with a ballad of the 'Bonny Hind' class would be paralleled in Danish,
for in 'Redselille og Medelvold' <b>T</b> (and perhaps <b>I</b>, see
Grundtvig's note, <span class="smcap">V</span>, 237), the knight is the lady's brother.</p>

<p>The "auld son" in <b>B</b>, like the first bringing home of the <i>young</i>
son in <b>A</b> 45, 47, shows how completely the proper story has been
lost sight of. There should be no son of any description at the point
at which this stanza comes in, and <i>auld</i> son should everywhere be
<i>young</i> son. The best we can do, to make sense of stanza 3, is to put
it after 8, with the understanding that woman and child are carried
off for burial; though really there is no need to move them on that
account. The shooting of the child is unintelligible in the mutilated
state of the ballad. It is apparently meant to be an accident. Nothing
of the kind occurs in other ballads of the class, and the divergence is
probably a simple corruption.</p>

<p>The ballad which 'Leesome Brand' represents is preserved among the
Scandinavian races under four forms.</p>

which is the oldest, being from late in the 17th century; also the

<p>All the Scandinavian versions are in two-line stanzas save Danish 272
<b>B</b>, and <b>A</b> in part, and Icelandic 17 <b>C</b>, which are in

<p>It will be most convenient to give first a summary of the story of
'Redselille og Medelvold,' and to notice the chief divergences of
the other ballads afterwards. A mother and her daughter are engaged
in weaving gold tissue. The mother sees milk running from the girl's
breasts, and asks an explanation. After a slight attempt at evasion,
the daughter confesses that she has been beguiled by a knight. The
mother threatens both with punishment: he shall be hanged [burned,
broken on the wheel, sent out of the country, i.e., sold into
servitude], and she sent away [broiled on a gridiron, burned, drowned].
Some copies begin further back, with a stanza or two in which we are
told that the knight has served in the king's court, and gained the
favor of the king's daughter. Alarmed by her mother's threats, the
maid goes to her lover's house at night, and after some difficulty in
effecting an entrance (a commonplace, like the ill-boding milk above)
informs him of the fate that awaits them. The knight is sufficiently
prompt now, and bids her get her gold together while he saddles
his horse. They ride away, with [or without] precautions against
discovery, and come to a wood. Four Norwegian versions, <b>A</b>,
<b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>G</b>, and also two Icelandic versions,
<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, of 'Sønnens Sorg,' interpose a piece of water,
and a difficulty in crossing, owing to the ferryman's refusing help
or the want of oars; but this passage is clearly an infiltration from
a different story. Arriving at the wood, the maid desires to rest a
while. The customary interrogation does not fail,&mdash;whether the way
is too long or the saddle too small. The knight lifts her off the
horse, spreads his cloak for her on the grass, and she gives way to
her anguish in such exclamations as "My mother had nine women: would
that I had the worst of them!" "My mother would never have been so
angry with me but she would have helped me in this strait!" Most of
the Danish versions make the knight offer to bandage his eyes and
render such service as a man may; but she replies that she would rather
die than that man should know of woman's pangs. So Swedish <b>H</b>,
nearly. Partly to secure privacy, and partly from thirst, she expresses
a wish for water, and her lover goes in search of some.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-180" id="Pg_1-180">[Pg 180]</a></span> (This in
nearly all the Danish ballads, and many of the others. But in four of
the Norwegian versions of 'Sønnens Sorg' the lover is told to go and
amuse himself, much as in our ballads.) When he comes to the spring
or the brook, there sits a nightingale and sings. <i>Two</i> nightingales,
a small bird, a voice from heaven, a small dwarf, an old man, replace
the nightingale in certain copies, and in others there is nothing at
all; but the great majority has a single nightingale, and, as Grundtvig
points out, the single bird is right, for the bird is really a vehicle
for the soul of the dead Redselille. The nightingale sings, "Redselille
lies dead in the wood, with two sons [son and daughter] in her bosom."
All that the nightingale has said is found to be true. According to
Danish <b>O</b> and Swedish <b>C</b>, the knight finds the lady and a
child, according to Swedish <b>B</b> and Norwegian <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>,
<b>C</b>, the lady and two sons, dead. In Danish <b>B</b>, <b>L</b>
(as also the Icelandic 'Sonar Harmur,' <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, and Danish
'Stalbroders Kvide,' <b>A</b>) the knight digs a grave, and lays mother
and children in it; he lays himself with them in <b>A</b> and <b>M</b>.
It is not said whether the children are dead or living, and the point
would hardly be raised but for what follows. In Danish <b>D</b>,
<b>P</b> and Swedish <b>F</b>, it is expressly mentioned that the
children are <i>alive</i>, and in <b>Q</b>, <b>R</b>, <b>S</b>, <b>T</b>,
<b>U</b>, six copies of <b>V</b>, and <b>Y</b>, and also in 'Bolde
Hr. Nilaus' Løn,' and in 'Sønnens Sorg,' Danish <b>A</b>, Norwegian
<b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, the children are heard, or seem
to be heard, shrieking from under the ground. Nearly all the versions
make the knight run himself through with his sword, either immediately
after the others are laid in the grave, or after he has ridden far and
wide, because he cannot endure the cries of the children from under the
earth. This would seem to be the original conclusion of the story; the
horrible circumstance of the children being buried alive is much more
likely to be slurred over or omitted at a later day than to be added.</p>

<p>We may pass over in silence the less important variations in the
very numerous versions of 'Redselille and Medelvold,' nor need we be
detained long by the other three Scandinavian forms of the ballad.
'Sønnens Sorg' stands in the same relation to 'Redselille and
Medelvold' as 'Hildebrand and Hilde,' does to 'Ribold and Guldborg'
(see p. 89 of this volume); that is, the story is told in the first
person instead of the third. A father asks his son why he is so sad,
Norwegian <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, Icelandic <b>A</b>,
<b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>. Five years has he sat at his father's
board, and never uttered a merry word. The son relates the tragedy of
his life. He had lived in his early youth at the house of a nobleman,
who had three daughters. He was on very familiar terms with all of
them, and the youngest loved him. When the time came for him to leave
the family, she proposed that he should take her with him, Danish
<b>B</b>, Icelandic <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b> [<i>he</i> makes the
proposal in Norwegian <b>C</b>]. From this point the narrative is much
the same as in 'Redselille and Medelvold,' and at the conclusion he
falls dead in his father's arms [at the table], Norwegian <b>A</b>,
<b>B</b>, <b>D</b>, Icelandic <b>A</b>. The mother takes the place of
the father in Danish <b>B</b> and Swedish, and perhaps it is the mother
who tells the story in English <b>A</b>, but the bad condition of the
text scarcely enables us to say. Danish <b>B</b> and the Swedish copy
have lost the middle and end of the proper story: there is no wood, no
childbirth, no burial. The superfluous boat of some Norwegian versions
of 'Redselille' reappears in these, and also in Icelandic <b>A</b>,
<b>B</b>; it is overturned in a storm, and the lady is drowned.</p>

<p>'Stalbroders Kvide' differs from 'Sønnens Sorg' only in this: that the
story is related to a comrade instead of father or mother.</p>

<p>'Bolde Hr. Nilaus' Løn,' which exists but in a single copy, has a
peculiar beginning. Sir Nilaus has served eight years in the king's
court without recompense. He has, however, gained the favor of the
king's daughter, who tells him that she is suffering much on his
account. If this be so, says Nilaus, I will quit the land with speed.
He is told to wait till she has spoken to her mother. She goes to
her mother and says: Sir Nilaus has served eight years, and had no
reward; he desires the best that it is in your power to give. The queen
exclaims, He shall never have my only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-181" id="Pg_1-181">[Pg 181]</a></span> daughter's hand! The young lady
immediately bids Nilaus saddle his horse while she collects her gold,
and from this point we have the story of Redselille.</p>

<p>A mother inquires into her daughter's condition, and learns that she
is going with child by a trooper (he is called both 'ruiter' and
'landsknecht'). The conversation is overheard by the other party, who
asks the girl whether she will ride with him or bide with her mother.
She chooses to go with him, and as they ride is overtaken with pains.
She asks whether there is not a house where she can rest. The soldier
builds her a hut of thistles, thorns, and high stakes, and hangs his
cloak over the aperture. She asks him to go away, and to come back when
he hears a cry: but the maid was dead ere she cried. The trooper laid
his head on a stone, and his heart brake with grief.</p>

<p><b>German.</b> <b>A</b>, Simrock, No 40, p. 92, 'Von Farbe so bleich,'
from Bonn and Rheindorf, repeated in Mittler, No 194. The mother, on
learning her daughter's plight, imprecates a curse on her. The maid
betakes herself to her lover, a trooper, who rides off with her. They
come to a cool spring, and she begs for a fresh drink, but, feeling
very ill, asks if there is no hamlet near, from which she could have
woman's help. The aid of the trooper is rejected in the usual phrase,
and he is asked to go aside, and answer when called. If there should
be no call, she will be dead. There was no call, and she was found
to be dead, with two sons in her bosom. The trooper wrapped the
children in her apron, and dug her grave with his sword. <b>B</b>,
Reifferscheid, Westfälische Volkslieder, p. 106, 'Ach Wunder über
Wunder,' from Bökendorf: much the same as to the story. <b>C</b>,
Mittler, No 195, p. 175, 'Von Farbe so bleich,' a fragment of a copy
from Hesse; Zuccalmaglio, p. 187, No 90, 'Die Waisen,' an entire copy,
ostensibly from the Lower Rhine, but clearly owing its last fourteen
stanzas to the editor. The trooper, in this supplement, leaves the boys
with his mother, and goes over seas. The boys grow up, and set out to
find their father. In the course of their quest, they pass a night in
a hut in a wood, and are overheard saying a prayer for their father
and dead mother, by a person who announces herself as their maternal
grandmother! After this it is not surprising that the father himself
should turn up early the next morning. The same editor, under the name
of Montanus, gives in Die deutschen Volksfeste, p. 45 f, a part of this
ballad again, with variations which show his hand beyond a doubt. We
are here informed that the ballad has above a hundred stanzas, and that
the conclusion is that the grandmother repents her curse, makes her
peace with the boys, and builds a convent.</p>

<p><b>French.</b> Bujeaud, Chants et Chansons populaires des provinces
de l'Ouest, <b>A</b>, <span class="smcap">I</span>, 198, <b>B</b>, <span class="smcap">I</span>, 200,
'J'entends le rossignolet.' <b>A</b>. This ballad has suffered injury
at the beginning and the end, but still preserves very well the chief
points of the story. A lover has promised his mistress that after
returning from a long absence he would take her to see his country.
While traversing a wood she is seized with her pains. The aid of her
companion is declined: "Cela n'est point votre métier." She begs for
water. The lover goes for some, and meets a lark, who tells him that he
will find his love dead, with a child in her arms. Two stanzas follow
which are to no purpose. <b>B</b>. The other copy of this ballad has
a perverted instead of a meaningless conclusion, but this keeps some
traits that are wanting in <b>A</b>. It is a two-line ballad, with the
nightingale in the refrain: "J'entends le rossignolet." A fair maid,
walking with her lover, falls ill, and lies down under a thorn. The
lover asks if he shall go for her mother. "She would not come: she has
a cruel heart." Shall I go for mine? "Go, like the swallow!" He comes
back and finds his love dead, and says he will die with his mistress.
The absurd conclusion follows that she was feigning death to test his
love.</p>

<p>The names in the Scandinavian ballads, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-182" id="Pg_1-182">[Pg 182]</a></span> is remarked by Grundtvig,
<span class="smcap">V</span>, 242, 291, are not Norse, but probably of German derivation,
and, if such, would indicate a like origin for the story. The man's
name, for instance, in the Danish 'Sønnens Sorg,' <b>A</b>, Gysellannd,
seems to point to Gisalbrand or Gisalbald, German names of the 8th or
9th century. There is some doubt whether this Gysellannd is not due
to a corruption arising in the course of tradition (see Grundtvig,
<span class="smcap">V</span>, 302); but if the name may stand, it will account for our
Leesome Brand almost as satisfactorily as Hildebrand does for Earl
Brand in No 7.</p>

<p>The passage in which the lady refuses male assistance during her
travail&mdash;found as well in almost all the Danish versions of 'Redselille
and Medelvold,' in the German and French, and imperfectly in Swedish
<b>D</b>&mdash;occurs in several other English ballads, viz., 'The Birth
of Robin Hood,' 'Rose the Red and White Lily,' 'Sweet Willie,' of
Finlay's Scottish Ballads, <span class="smcap">II</span>, 61, 'Burd Helen,' of Buchan,
<span class="smcap">II</span>, 30, 'Bonnie Annie,' No 23. Nearly the whole of the scene
in the wood is in 'Wolfdietrich.' Wolfdietrich finds a dead man and
a woman naked to the girdle, who is clasping the stem of a tree. The
man, who was her husband, was taking her to her mother's house, where
her first child was to be born, when he was attacked by the dragon
Schadesam. She was now in the third day of her travail. Wolfdietrich,
having first wrapped her in his cloak, offers his help, requesting
her to tear a strip from her shift and bind it round his eyes. She
rejects his assistance in this form, but sends him for water, which he
brings in his helmet, but only to find the woman dead, with a lifeless
child at her breast. He wraps mother and child in his mantle, carries
them to a chapel, and lays them on the altar; then digs a grave with
his sword, goes for the body of the man, and buries all three in the
grave he has made. Grimm, Altdänische Heldenlieder, p. 508; Holtzmann,

<p>The three stanzas of this ballad which are found in the Musical Museum
(<b>C</b>) were furnished, it is said, by Burns. It was first printed
in full (<b>A b</b>) in Motherwell's Minstrelsy. Motherwell retouched
a verse here and there slightly, to regulate the metre. <b>A a</b> is
here given as it stands in his manuscript. <b>B</b> consists of some
scattered verses as remembered by Sir W. Scott.</p>

<p>The directions in 3, 4 receive light from a passage in 'Robin Hood's

<p>A defective copy of this ballad was printed in Cromek's Select Scottish
Songs, Ancient and Modern, 1810 (<b>D</b>). A fragment, comprising
the first half of the story, was inserted in "Lowran Castle, or the
Wild Boar of Curridoo: with other Tales," etc., by Robert Trotter,
Dumfries, 1822<a name="FNanchor_1_159" id="FNanchor_1_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> (<b>F</b>). A complete copy was first given in
Kinloch's Ancient Scottish Ballads, 1827 (<b>G</b>); another, described
by the editor as made up from Cromek's fragment and two copies from
recitation, in Motherwell's Minstrelsy, p. 36,<a name="FNanchor_1_160" id="FNanchor_1_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> later in the same
year; and a third, closely resembling Kinloch's, in Buchan's Ballads
of the North of Scotland, in 1828 (<b>H</b>). Three versions complete,
or nearly so, and a fragment of a fourth are now printed for the first
time, all from Motherwell's manuscripts (<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>,
<b>E</b>).</p>

<p>The stanza about the auger bore [wimble bore], <b>B</b> 1, <b>F</b> 3,
<b>H</b> 4, is manifestly out of place. It is found in '<a href="#Ballad_27">The Whummil
Bore</a>' (see further on), and may have slipped into 'Hind Horn' by reason
of its following, in its proper place, a stanza beginning, "Seven lang
years I hae served the king:" cf. <b>F</b> 2, <b>H</b> 3.</p>

<p><b>G</b> 17, 18, 21, 22, which are not intelligible in their present
connection, are perhaps, as well as <b>G</b> 16, <b>H</b> 18-20,
borrowed from some Robin Hood ballad, in which a change is made with a
beggar.</p>

<p>The noteworthy points in the story of Hind Horn are these. Hind Horn
has served the king seven years (<b>D</b>, <b>F</b>), and has fallen
in love with his daughter. She gives Hind Horn a jewelled ring: as
long as the stone keeps its color, he may know that she is faithful;
but if it changes hue, he may ken she loves another man. The king is
angry (<b>D</b>), and Hind Horn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-188" id="Pg_1-188">[Pg 188]</a></span> goes to sea [is sent, <b>D</b>]. He
has been gone seven years, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b> [seven years and a day,
<b>B</b>], when, looking on his ring, he sees that the stone is pale
and wan, <b>A-H</b>. He makes for the land at once, and, meeting an old
beggar, asks him for news. No news but the king's daughter's wedding:
it has lasted nine days [two and forty, <b>A</b>], and she will not go
into the bride-bed till she hears of Hind Horn, <b>E</b>. Hind Horn
changed cloaks and other gear with the beggar, and when he came to the
king's gate asked for a drink in Horn's name,<a name="FNanchor_1_161" id="FNanchor_1_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>,
<b>D</b>. The bride herself came down, and gave him a drink out of her
own hand, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>. He drank
out the drink and dropped in the ring.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'O gat ye 't by sea, or gat ye 't by lan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or gat ye 't aff a dead man's han?'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>So she asked; and he answered:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'I gat na 't by sea, I gat na 't by lan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I gat it out of your own han.' <b>D</b> 14.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">'But I got it at my wooing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I'll gie it at your wedding.' <b>G</b> 29, 30.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The bride, who had said,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'I'll go through nine fires so hot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I'll give him a drink for Young Hynhorn's sake,' <b>B</b> 16,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>But Hind Horn let his cloutie cloak fall, <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>, and told

<p>The story of Horn, of which this ballad gives little more than the
catastrophe, is related at full in</p>

<p>I. 'King Horn,' a <i>gest</i> in about 1550 short verses, preserved in
three manuscripts: the oldest regarded as of the second half of the
13th century, or older; the others put at 1300 and a little later. All
three have been printed: (1.) By Michel, Horn et Rimenhild, p. 259 ff,
Bannatyne Club, 1845; J. R. Lumby, Early English Text Society, 1866;
and in editions founded on Lumby's text, by Mätzner, Altenglische
Sprachproben, p. 270 ff, and later by Wissmann, Quellen u. Forschungen,
No 45. (2.) By Horstmann, Archiv für das Studium der neueren Sprachen,
1872, <span class="smcap">L</span>, 39 ff. (3.) By Ritson, A.E. Metrical Romanceës,
<span class="smcap">II</span>, 91 ff.</p>

<p>II. 'Horn et Rymenhild,' a romance in about 5250 heroic verses,
preserved likewise in three manuscripts; the best in the Public Library
of the University of Cambridge, and of the 14th century.</p>

<p>III. 'Horn Childe and Maiden Rimnild,' from a manuscript of the 14th
century, in not quite 100 twelve-line stanzas: Ritson, Metrical
Romanceës, <span class="smcap">III</span>, 282 ff; Michel, p. 341 ff.</p>

<p>Horn, in the old English <i>gest</i>, is son of Murry [Allof], king of
Suddenne. He is a youth of extraordinary beauty, and has twelve
comrades, of whom Athulf and Fikenild are his favorites. One day, as
Murry was out riding, he came upon fifteen ships of Saracens, just
arrived. The pagans slew the king, and insured themselves, as they
thought, against Horn's future revenge by putting him and his twelve
aboard a vessel without sail or rudder; but "the children" drove to
shore, unhurt, on the coast of Westerness. The king, Ailmar, gave them
a kind reception, and committed them to Athelbrus, his steward, to be
properly brought up. Rymenhild, the king's daughter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-189" id="Pg_1-189">[Pg 189]</a></span> fell in love
with Horn, and having, with some difficulty, prevailed upon Athelbrus
to bring him to her bower, offered herself to him as his wife. It were
no fair wedding, Horn told her, between a thrall and a king,&mdash;a speech
which hurt Rymenhild greatly; and Horn was so moved by her grief that
he promised to do all she required, if she would induce the king to
knight him. This was done the next day, and Horn at once knighted all
his comrades. Rymenhild again sent for Horn, and urged him now to make
her his wife. But Horn said he must first prove his knighthood: if he
came back alive, he would then marry her. Upon this Rymenhild gave him
a ring, set with stones of such virtue that he could never be slain
if he looked on it and thought of his leman. The young knight had
the good fortune to fall in immediately with a ship full of heathen
hounds, and by the aid of his ring killed a hundred of the best of
them. The next day he paid Rymenhild a visit, and found her drowned in
grief on account of a bad dream. She had cast her net in the sea, and
a great fish had broken it: she weened she should lose the fish that
she would choose. Horn strove to comfort her, but could not conceal
his apprehension that trouble was brewing. The fish proved to be
Fikenild, Horn's much cherished friend. He told Ailmar of the intimacy
with Rymenhild, and asserted that Horn meant to kill the king as well
as marry the princess. Ailmar was very angry (v. 724, Wissmann), and
much grieved, too. He found the youth in his daughter's bower, and
ordered him to quit the land anon. Horn saddled his horse and armed
himself, then went back to Rymenhild, and told her that he was going
to a strange land for seven years: if, after that, he neither came nor
sent word, she might take a husband. He sailed a good way eastward (v.
799) to Ireland, and, landing, met two princes, who invited him to take
service with their father. The king, Thurston, welcomed him, and had
soon occasion to employ him; for at Christmas came into court a giant,
with a message from pagans newly arrived. They proposed that one of
them should fight three Christians:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'If your three slay our one.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let all this land be your own;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If our one oercomes your three,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All this land then ours shall be.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Horn scorned to fight on such terms; he alone would undertake three of
the hounds; and so he did. In the course of a hard fight it came out
that these were the very heathen that had slain King Murry. Horn looked
on his ring and thought on Rymenhild, then fell on his foes. Not a man
of them escaped; but King Thurston lost many men in the fight, among
them his two sons. Having now no heir, he offered Horn his daughter
Reynild and the succession. Horn replied that he had not earned such a
reward yet. He would serve the king further; and when he asked for his
daughter, he hoped the king would not refuse her.</p>

<p>Seven years Horn stayed with King Thurston, and to Rymenhild neither
sent nor went. A sorry time it was for her, and worst at the end, for
King Modi of Reynis asked her in marriage, and her father consented.
The wedding was to be in a few days. Rymenhild despatched messengers to
every land, but Horn heard nothing, till one day, when he was going out
to shoot, he encountered one of these, and learned how things stood. He
sent word to his love not to be troubled; he would be there betimes.
But, alas, the messenger was drowned on his way back, and Rymenhild,
peering out of her door for a ray of hope, saw his body washed up by
the waves. Horn now made a clean breast to Thurston, and asked for
help. This was generously accorded, and Horn set sail for Westerness.
He arrived not too early on the day of the wedding,&mdash;"ne might he come
no later!"&mdash;left his men in a wood, and set off for Ailmar's court
alone. He met a palmer, and asked his news. The palmer had come from a
bridal; a wedding of maid Rymenhild, who wept and would not be married,
because she had a husband, though he was out of the land. Horn changed
clothes with the palmer, put on the sclavin, took scrip and staff,
blackened his skin and twisted his lip, and presented himself at the
king's gate. The porter would not let him in; Horn kicked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-190" id="Pg_1-190">[Pg 190]</a></span> open the
wicket, threw the porter over the bridge, made his way into the hall,
and sat down in the beggars' row. Rymenhild was weeping as if she were
out of her wits, but after meat she rose to give all the knights and
squires drink from a horn which she bare: such was the custom. Horn
called to her:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Skink us with the first,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The beggars ben athirst.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She laid down her horn and filled him a gallon bowl; but Horn would not
drink of that. He said, mysteriously, "Thou thinkest I am a beggar, but
I am a fisher, come far from the East, to fish at thy feast. My net
lies near at hand, and hath full seven year. I am come to see if it has
taken any fish.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'I am come to fish;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drink to me from thy dish,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drink to Horn from horn!'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Rymenhild looked at him, a chill creeping over her heart. What he meant
by his fishing she did not see. She filled her horn and drank to him,
handed it to the pilgrim, and said, "Drink thy fill, and tell me if
ever thou saw Horn." Horn drank, and threw the ring into the vessel.
When the princess went to bower, she found the ring she had given Horn.
She feared he was dead, and sent for the palmer. The palmer said Horn
had died on the voyage to Westerness, and had begged him to go with the
ring to Rymenhild. Rymenhild could bear no more. She threw herself on
her bed, where she had hid a knife, to kill both King Modi and herself
if Horn should not come; she set the knife to her heart, and there Horn
stopped her. He wiped off the black, and cried, "I am Horn!" Great was
their bliss, but it was not a time to indulge themselves fully.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Horn sprang out of hall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let his sclavin fall,      (1246)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and went to summon his knights. Rymenhild sent after him the faithful
Athulf, who all the while had been watching for Horn in the tower. They
slew all that were in the castle, except King Ailmar and Horn's old
comrades. Horn spared even Fikenild, taking an oath of fidelity from
him and the rest. Then he made himself known to Ailmar, denied what he
had been charged with, and would not marry Rymenhild even now, not till
he had won back Suddenne. This he went immediately about; but while he
was engaged in clearing the land of Saracens and rebuilding churches,
the false Fikenild bribed young and old to side with him, built a
strong castle, "married" Rymenhild, carried her into his fortress, and
began a feast. Horn, warned in a dream, again set sail for Westerness,
and came in by Fikenild's new castle. Athulf's cousin was on the shore,
to tell him what had happened; how Fikenild had wedded Rymenhild that
very day; he had beguiled Horn twice. Force would not avail now. Horn
disguised himself and some of his knights as harpers and fiddlers,
and their music gained them admittance. Horn began a lay which threw
Rymenhild into a swoon. This smote him to the heart; he looked on his
ring and thought of her. Fikenhild and his men were soon disposed
of. Horn was in a condition to reward all his faithful adherents. He
married Athulf to Thurston's daughter, and made Rymenhild queen of
Suddenne.</p>

<p>The French romance contains very nearly the same story, extended, by
expansions of various sorts, to about six times the length of King
Horn. It would be out of place to notice other variations than those
which relate to the story preserved in the ballads. Rimild offers Horn
a ring when she first avows her love. He will not take it then, but
accepts a second tender, after his first fight. When he is accused to
the king, he offers to clear himself by combat with heavy odds, but
will not submit, king's son as he is, to purgation by oath. The king
says, then he may quit the land and go&mdash;to Norway, if he will. Horn
begs Rimild to maintain her love for him seven years. If he does not
come then, he will send her word to act thereafter at her pleasure.
Rimild exchanges the ring she had previously given him for one set with
a sap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-191" id="Pg_1-191">[Pg 191]</a></span>phire, wearing which faithfully he need not fear death by water
nor fire, battle nor tourney (vv 2051-8). He looks at this ring when
he fights with the pagan that had killed his father, and it fires his
heart to extraordinary exploits (3166 ff). Having learned through a
friend, who had long been seeking him, that Rimild's father is about
to marry her to a young king (Modun), Horn returns to Brittany with a
large force. He leaves his men in a woody place, and goes out alone on
horseback for news; meets a palmer, who tells him that the marriage
is to take place that very day; gives the palmer his fine clothes
in exchange for sclavin, staff and scrip, forces his way into the
city, and is admitted to the banquet hall with the beggars. After the
guests had eaten (4152 ff), Rimild filled a splendid cup with piment,
presented it first <i>a sun dru</i>, and then, with her maids, served the
whole company. As she was making her fifth round, Horn pulled her by
the sleeve, and reproached her with attending only to the rich. "Your
credit would be greater should you serve <i>us</i>." She set a handsome cup
before him, but he would not drink. "Corn apelent Horn li Engleis," he
said. "If, for the love of him who bore that name, you would give me
the same horn that you offered your <i>ami</i>, I would share it with you."
All but fainting, Rimild gave him the horn. He threw in his ring, even
that which she had given him at parting, drank out half, and begged
her to drink by the love of him whom he had named. In drinking, she
sipped the ring into her mouth, and she saw at once what it was (4234).
"I have found a ring," said she. "If it is yours, take it. Blest be
he to whom I gave it: if you know aught of him, conceal it not. If
you are Horn, it were a great sin not to reveal yourself." Horn owned
that the ring was his, but denied knowledge of the man she spake of.
For himself, he had been reared in that land, and by service had come
into possession of a hawk, which, before taming it, he had put in a
cage: that was nigh seven years since: he had come now to see what it
amounted to. If it should prove to be as good as when he left it, he
would carry it away with him; but if its feathers were ruffled and
broken, he would have nothing to do with it. At this, Rimild broke into
a laugh, and cried, "Horn, 't is you, and your hawk has been safely
kept!"<a name="FNanchor_1_162" id="FNanchor_1_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> She would go with him or kill herself. Horn saw that she
had spoken truth, but, to try her yet further, said he was indeed Horn,
whom she had loved, but he had come back with nothing: why should she
follow a poor wretch who could not give her a gown to her back? "Little
do you know me," was her reply. "I can bear what you bear, and there is
no king in the East for whom I would quit you."</p>

<p>'Horn Childe and Maiden Rimnild,' with many diversities of its own as
to details, is more like the French than the English ro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-192" id="Pg_1-192">[Pg 192]</a></span>mance as to
the story, and, on the other hand, has one or two resemblances to the
ballads which they both lack. Rimnild's father, maddened by the traitor
Wikel's false information, beats her till she bleeds, and threatens to
slay Horn. Rimnild, expecting her lover to be at least exiled, assures
Horn that she will marry no other man for seven years. The king, who
had shut himself up till his first wrath was past, tells Horn, when he
next comes into his presence, that if he is found in the land on the
morrow, he shall be drawn with horses and hanged. Rimnild, at parting,
gives him a ring, with these words:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p class="source">(Michel, st. 48.)</p>

<p>Horn, for his part, bids her every day look into a spring in her arbor:
should she see his shadow, then he is about to marry another; till
then his thought will not have changed (sts 48, 49). Though loved, as
before, by another princess, Horn kept his faith; but when seven years
were gone, on looking at the stone he saw that its hue was changed (st.
71). He immediately gathered a force, and set sail for Rimnild. On
landing he saw a beggar, who turned out to be one of his old friends,
and had been looking for him a long time. That day Moging the king was
to marry Rimnild. They changed weeds (76); Horn forced his way into
the castle. While Rimnild was serving the guests, Horn, who had tried
to pass for a fool, called to her to attend to God's men. She fetched
him drink, and he said, "For Horn's love, if ever he was dear to thee,
go not ere this be drunk." He threw the ring into the cup: she brought
him another drink (something is wrong here, for nothing is said of her
seeing and recognizing the ring), and asked if Horn were there. She
fainted when she learned that he was, but on recovering sent Hatherof
(== Athulf) to bid the king make merry, and then to gather periwinkle
and ivy, "grasses that ben of main" (to stain her face with, no doubt),
and then to tell Horn to wait for her under a woodside.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'When al this folk is gon to play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He and Y schal steal oway,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bituene the day and the ni&#541;t.'      (87)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Hatherof did his message. Of true love Horn was sure. He said he would
come into the field with a hundred knights. A tournament follows, as
in the French romance; the royal bridegroom is unhorsed, but spared;
treachery is punished and forced to confession.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now is Rimnild tuiis wedde,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>That the lay or gest of King Horn is a far more primitive poem than
the French romance, and could not possibly be derived from it, will
probably be plain to any one who will make even a hasty comparison of
the two; and that the contrary opinion should have been held by such
men as Warton and Tyrwhitt must have been the result of a general
theory, not of a particular examination.<a name="FNanchor_1_163" id="FNanchor_1_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> There is, on the other
hand, no sufficient reason for supposing that the English lay is the
source of the other two poems. Nor do the special approximations of the
ballads to the romance of Horn Child oblige us to conclude that these,
or any of them, are derived from that poem. The particular resemblances
are the discoloration of the ring, the elopement with the bride, in
<b>C</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>H</b> (which is only prepared for, but not
carried out, in Horn Child), and the agreement between the couplet just
cited from Horn Child,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now is Rimnild tuiis wedde,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Horn brou&#541;t hir to his bedde,<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>The likeness evinces a closer affinity of the oral traditions with the
later English romance than with the earlier English or the French, but
no filiation. And were filiation to be accepted, there would remain
the question of priority. It is often assumed, without a misgiving,
that oral tradition must needs be younger than anything that was
committed to writing some centuries ago; but this requires in each case
to be made out; there is certainly no antecedent probability of that
kind.<a name="FNanchor_1_164" id="FNanchor_1_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<p>Two Scandinavian ballads, as Dr Prior has remarked, seem to have been
at least suggested by the romances of Horn.</p>

<p>(1.) 'Unge Hr. Tor og Jomfru Tore,' Grundtvig, No 72, <span class="smcap">II</span>,
263, translated by Prior, <span class="smcap">III</span>, 151. Of this there are two
traditional versions: <b>A</b> from a manuscript of the sixteenth
century, <b>B</b> from one of the seventeenth. They agree in story. In
<b>A</b>, Tor asks Sølffuermord how long she will wait for him. Nine
years, she answers, if she can do so without angering her friends.
He will be satisfied with eight. Eight have passed: a family council
is held, and it is decided that she shall not have Young Tor, but a
certain rich count. Her father "gives her away" that same day. The lady
goes up to a balcony and looks seaward. Everybody seems to be coming
home but her lover. She begs her brother to ride down to the shore
for her. Tor is just coming in, hails the horseman, and eagerly asks
how are the maids in the isle. The brother tells him that <i>his</i> maid
has waited eight years, and is even now drinking her bridal, but with
tears. Tor takes his harp and chess-board, and plays outside the bridal
hall till the bride hears and knows him. He then enters the hall, and
asks if there is anybody that can win a game of chess. The father
replies, Nobody but Sølffuermord, and she sits a bride at the board.
The mother indulgently suggests that the midsummer day is long, and the
bride might well try a game. The bride seeks an express sanction of
her father, who lessons her the livelong day, being suspicious of Tor,
but towards evening consents to her playing a little while,&mdash;not long.
Tor wins the first game, and must needs unpack his heart in a gibing
parable, ending</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Full hard is gold to win,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so is a trothless quean.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She wins the next game, takes up the parable, and says</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Many were glad their faith to hold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were their lot to be controlled.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>They are soon at one, and resolve to fly. They slip away, go aboard
Tor's ship, and put off. The bride's parents get information, and the
mother, who is a professor of the black art, raises a storm which she
means shall sink them both. No one can steer the ship but the bride.
She stands at the helm, with her gold crown on, while her lover is
lying seasick on the deck, and she brings the craft safe into Norway,
where a second wedding is celebrated.</p>

<p>(2.) The other ballad is 'Herr Lovmand og Herr Thor,' Syv, iv, No
68, Danske Viser, <span class="smcap">IV</span>, 180, No 199, translated by Prior,
<span class="smcap">II</span>, 442. Lovmand, having betrothed Ingelil, asks how long she
will be his maid. "Eight years, if I may," she says. This term has
elapsed; her brothers consult, and give her to rich Herr Thor. They
drink the bridal for five days; for nine days; she will not go to bed.
On the evening of the tenth, they begin to use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-194" id="Pg_1-194">[Pg 194]</a></span> force. She begs that
she may first go to the look-out up-stairs. From there she sees ships,
great and small, and the sails which her own hands have made for her
lover. Her brother goes down to the sea, as in the other ballad, and
has a similar interview. Lovmand has the excuse of having been sick
seven years. He borrows the brother's horse, flies faster than a bird,
and the torch is burning at the door of the bride's house when he
arrives. Thor is reasonable enough to give up the bride, and to accept
Lovmand's sister.</p>

<p>The ballad is extremely common in Sweden, and at least six versions
have been published. <b>A</b>, 'Herr Lagman och Herr Thor,' from a
manuscript of the end of the sixteenth century, Arwidsson, <span class="smcap">I</span>,
165, No 24; <b>B</b>, from a manuscript, <i>ib.</i>, p. 168; <b>C</b>,
from oral tradition, p. 171; <b>D</b>, 'Lageman och hans Brud,' Eva
Wigström, Folkdiktning samlad och upptecknad i Skåne, p. 29, No 12;
<b>E</b>, 'Stolt Ingrid,' Folkvisor fråu Skåne, upptecknade af E.
Wigström, in Hazelius, Ur de nordiska Folkens Lif, p. 121, No 3;
<b>F</b>, 'Deielill och Lageman,' Fagerlund, Anteckningar om Korpo och
Houtskärs Socknar, p. 192, No 3. In <b>A</b>, <b>D</b> the bride goes
off in her lover's ship; in <b>C</b> he carries her off on his horse,
when the dancing is at its best, and subsequently, upon the king's
requisition, settles matters with his rival by killing him in single
fight. The stolid bridegroom, in the others, consents to a peaceable
arrangement.</p>

<p>Certain points in the story of Horn&mdash;the long absence, the sudden
return, the appearance under disguise at the wedding feast, and the
dropping of the ring into a cup of wine obtained from the bride&mdash;repeat
themselves in a great number of romantic tales. More commonly it is a
husband who leaves his wife for seven years, is miraculously informed
on the last day that she is to be remarried on the morrow, and is
restored to his home in the nick of time, also by superhuman means.
Horn is warned to go back, in the ballads and in Horn Child, by the
discoloration of his ring, but gets home as he can; this part of the
story is slurred over in a way that indicates a purpose to avoid a
supernatural expedient.</p>

<p>Very prominent among the stories referred to is that of Henry of
Brunswick [Henry the Lion, Reinfrid of Brunswick], and this may well be
put first, because it is preserved in Scandinavian popular ballads.<a name="FNanchor_1_165" id="FNanchor_1_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p>(1.) The latest of these, a Swedish ballad, from a collection made
at the end of the last century, 'Hertig Henrik,' Arwidsson, No 168,
<span class="smcap">II</span>, 422, represents Duke Henry as telling his wife that he is
minded to go off for seven years (he says not whither, but it is of
course to the East); should he stay eight or nine, she may marry the
man she fancies. He cuts a ring in two; gives her one half and keeps
the other. He is made captive, and serves a heathen lord and lady seven
years, drawing half the plough, "like another horse." His liberation is
not accounted for, but he was probably set free by his mistress, as in
the ballad which follows. He gets possession of an excellent sword, and
uses it on an elephant who is fighting with a lion. The grateful lion
transports the duke to his own country while he is asleep. A herdsman,
of whom he asks food, recommends him to go to the Brunswick mansion,
where there is a wedding, and Duke Henry's former spouse is the bride.
When Henry comes to the house, his daughter is standing without; he
asks food for a poor pilgrim. She replies that she has never heard of a
pilgrim taking a lion about with him. But they give him drink, and the
bride, <i>pro more</i>, drinks out of the same bowl, and finds the half ring
in the bottom. The bride feels in her pocket and finds her half,<a name="FNanchor_1_166" id="FNanchor_1_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>
and the two, when thrown upon a table, run together and make one ring. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-195" id="Pg_1-195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p>(2.) The Danish ballad<a name="FNanchor_1_167" id="FNanchor_1_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> (Grundtvig, No 114, <b>B</b>, from a 17th
century manuscript), relates that Duke Henry, in consequence of a
dream, took leave of his wife, enjoining her to wait to the eighth
year, and, if then he did not return, marry whom she liked. In the
course of his fights with the heathen, Henry was made captive, and had
to draw the harrow and plough, like a beast. One day (during his lord's
absence, as we learn from <b>A</b>) the heathen lady whom he served set
him free. He had many adventures, and in one of them killed a panther
who was pressing a lion hard, for which service the lion followed him
like a dog. The duke then happened upon a hermit, who told him that his
wife was to be married the next day, but he was to go to sleep, and not
be concerned. He laid his head on a stone in the heathen land, and woke
in a trice to hear German speech from a herdsman's mouth. The herdsman
confirmed what the hermit had said: the duchess was to be married on
the morrow. The duke went to the kitchen as a pilgrim, and sent word to
the lady that he wished to drink to her. The duchess, surprised at this
freedom, summoned him into her presence. The verses are lost in which
the cup should be given the pilgrim and returned to the lady. When she
drank off the wine that was left, a half ring lay in the glass.</p>

<p>Danish <b>A</b>, though of the 16th century, does not mention the ring.</p>

<p>(3.) A Flemish broadside, which may originally have been of the 15th
century, relates the adventures of the Duke of Brunswick in sixty-five
stanzas of four long lines: reprinted in von der Hagen's Germania,
<span class="smcap">VIII</span>, 359, and Hoffmann's Niederländische Volkslieder, No 2,
p. 6; Coussemaker, No 47, p. 152; abridged and made over, in Willems,
O. v. L., p. 251, No 107. The duke, going to war, tells his wife to
marry again if he stays away seven years. She gives him half of her
ring. Seven years pass, and the duke, being then in desperate plight
in a wilderness, is taken off by a ship; by providential direction, no
doubt, though at first it does not so appear. For the fiend is aboard,
who tells him that his wife is to be married to-morrow, and offers, for
his soul, to carry him to his palace in his sleep before day. The duke,
relying on heaven and his lion, professes to accept the terms: he is to
be taken to his palace <i>in his sleep</i>. The lion rouses his master at
the right time, and the fiend is baffled. The duke goes to the marriage
feast, and sends a message to the bride that he desires a drink from
her in memory of her lord. They take him for a beggar, but the lady
orders him wine in a gold cup. The cup goes back to her with the duke's
half ring in it. She cries, "It is my husband!" joins her half to the
one in the cup, and the two adhere firmly.</p>

<p>(4.) A German poem of the 15th century, by Michel Wyssenhere, in
ninety-eight stanzas of seven lines, first printed by Massmann,
Denkmæler deutscher Sprache und Literatur, p. 122, and afterwards by
Erlach, <span class="smcap">II</span>, 290, and elsewhere. The Lord of Brunswick receives
an impression in a dream that he ought to go to the Holy Sepulchre. He
cuts a ring in two, and gives his wife one half for a souvenir, but
fixes no time for his absence, and so naturally says nothing about her
taking another husband. He has the adventures which are usual in other
versions of the story, and at last finds himself among the Wild Hunt
(das wöden her), and obliges one of the company, by conjurations, to
tell him how it is with his wife and children. The spirit informs him
that his wife is about to marry another man. He then constrains the
spirit to transport him and his lion to his castle. This is done on the
same terms as in the Flemish poem, and the lion wakes his master. His
wife offers him drink; he lets his half ring drop in the glass, and,
upon the glass being returned to the lady, she takes out the token,
finds it like her half, and cries out that she has recovered her dear
husband and lord.</p>

<p>(5.) Henry the Lion, a chap-book printed in the 16th century, in one
hundred and four stanzas of eight short verses; reprinted in Büsching's
Volkssagen, Märchen und Legenden, p. 213 ff, and (modernized) by
Sim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-196" id="Pg_1-196">[Pg 196]</a></span>rock in the first volume of Die deutschen Volksbücher. The hero
goes out simply in quest of adventures, and, having lost his ship and
all his companions, is floating on a raft with his lion, when the devil
comes to him and tells him that his wife is to remarry. A compact is
made, and the devil balked, as before. Though we were not so informed
at the beginning, it now turns out that the duke had given a half ring
to the duchess seven years before, and had bidden her take a second
husband if he did not come back in that time. The duke sends a servant
to beg a drink of wine of his wife, and returns the cup, as in (3), (4).</p>

<p>(6.) A ballad in nine seven-line stanzas, supposed to be by a
Meistersinger, preserved in broadsides of about 1550 and 1603, Böhme,
No 5, p. 30, Erk's Wunderhorn, <span class="smcap">IV</span>, 111. (7.) Hans Sachs's

<p>(9.) Reinfrid von Braunschweig, c. 1300, ed. Bartsch, 1871. Reinfrid
is promised by the Virgin, who appears to him thrice in vision, that
he shall have issue if he will go over sea to fight the heathen. He
breaks a ring which his wife had given him, and gives her one half,
vv. 14,906-11. If he dies, she is to marry, for public reasons, vv.
14,398-407; but she is not to believe a report of his death unless
she receives his half of the ring back, vv. 14,782-816, 15,040-049.
The latter part of the romance not being extant, we do not know
the conclusion, but a variation as to the use made of the ring is
probable.<a name="FNanchor_1_169" id="FNanchor_1_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p>The story of Reinfrit is also preserved in a Bohemian prose chap-book
printed before 1565. This prose is clearly a poem broken up, and it
is believed that the original should be placed in the first half
of the 14th century, or possibly at the end of the 13th. The hero
returns, in pilgrim's garb, after seven years' absence, to find his
wife about to be handed over by her father to another prince. He lets
his ring fall into a cup, and goes away; his wife recognizes the
ring, and is reunited to him. The story has passed from the Bohemian
into Russian and Magyar. Feifalik, Sitzungsberichte der phil.-hist.
Classe der Wiener Akademie, <span class="smcap">XXIX</span>, 83 ff, the ring at p. 92;
<span class="smcap">XXXII</span>, 322 ff.</p>

<p>Similar use is made of the ring in other German romances. (1.) 'Der
edle Moringer' (MS. of 14th century) asks his wife to wait seven years
for him, while he visits the land of St Thomas. He is warned by an
angel, at the expiration of that period, that he will lose her if he
does not go back, bewails himself to his patron, and is conveyed home
in a sleep. He begs an alms at his castle-gate in the name of God, St
Thomas, and the noble Moringer; is admitted to his wife's presence;
sings a lay describing his own case, which moves the lady much; throws
into a beaker of wine, which she sets before him, the ring by which
she was married to him, sends the cup back to her, and is recognized.
Böhme, No 6, p. 32; Uhland, No 298, p. 773. (2.) In the older
Hildebrandslied, which is of the 14th century, or earlier, the hero,
returning after an absence of thirty-two years, drops his ring into a
cup of wine presented to him by his wife. Böhme, No 1, p. 1; Uhland, No
132, p. 330. (3.) Wolfdietrich drops Ortnit's ring into a cup of wine
sent him by Liebgart, who has been adjudged to the Graf von Biterne in
consideration of his having, as he pretended, slain the dragon. The
cup is returned to the empress, the ring identified, the pretension
refuted, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-197" id="Pg_1-197">[Pg 197]</a></span> Liebgart given to Ortnit's avenger. Wolfdietrich B, ed.
Jänicke, <span class="smcap">I</span>, 280 ff, stanzas 767-785. (4.) King Rother (whose
history has passages of the strongest resemblance to Horn's), coming
to retrieve his wife, who has been kidnapped and carried back to her
father, lands below Constantinople, at a woody and hilly place, and
assumes a pilgrim's disguise. On his way to the city he meets a man
who tells him that Ymelot of Babylon has invaded Greece, and taken
Constantin, his wife's father, prisoner; and that Constantin, to save
his life, has consented to give his daughter to the heathen king's
son. Rother steals into the hall, and even under the table at which
the royal party are sitting, and contrives to slip his ring into the
hand of his distressed young queen, who, thus assured of his presence,
immediately recovers her spirits. Massmann, Deutsche Gedichte des
zw&#339;lften Jahrhunderts, Theil ii, p. 213, vv. 3687-3878.</p>

<p>One of the best and oldest stories of the kind we are engaged with is
transmitted by Cæsarius of Heisterbach in his Dialogus Miraculorum,
of the first quarter of the 13th century. Gerard, a soldier living in
Holenbach ("his grandchildren are still alive, and there is hardly a
man in the town who does not know about this"), being, like Moringer,
devoted to St Thomas of India, was impelled to visit his shrine. He
broke a ring and gave one half to his wife, saying, Expect me back in
five years, and marry whom you wish if I do not come then. The journey,
which would be long enough any way, was providentially protracted. He
reached the shrine at last, and said his prayers, and then remembered
that that was the last day of his fifth year. Alas, my wife will marry
again, he thought; and quite right he was, for the wedding was even
then preparing. A devil, acting under the orders of St Thomas, set
Gerard down at his own door. He found his wife supping with her second
partner, and dropped his half ring into her cup. She took it out,
fitted it to the half which had been given her, rushed into his arms,
and bade good-by to the new bridegroom. Ed. Strange, <span class="smcap">II</span>, 131.</p>

<p>A tradition closely resembling this has been found in Switzerland,
Gerard and St Thomas being exchanged for Wernhart von Strättlingen and
St Michael. Menzel's Odin, p. 96.</p>

<p>Another of the most remarkable tales of this class is exquisitely
told by Boccaccio in the Decamerone, G. x, N. ix. Messer Torello,
going to the crusade, begs his wife to wait a year, a month, and a day
before she marries again. The lady assures him that she will never
be another man's wife; but he replies that a woman young, beautiful,
and of high family, as she is, will not be allowed to have her way.
With her parting embrace she gives him a ring from her finger, saying,
If I die before I see you again, remember me when you look on this.
The Christians were wasted by an excessive mortality, and those who
escaped the ravages of disease fell into the hands of Saladin, and
were imprisoned by him in various cities, Torello in Alexandria. Here
he was recognized by Saladin, whom he had entertained with the most
delicate and splendid hospitality a few months before, when the soldan
was travelling through Italy in disguise. Saladin's return for this
courtesy was so magnificent as almost to put Lombardy out of Torello's
head,<a name="FNanchor_1_170" id="FNanchor_1_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> and besides he trusted that his wife had been informed of
his safety by a letter which he had sent. This was not so, however,
and the death of another Torello was reported in Italy as his, in
consequence of which his supposed widow was solicited in marriage, and
was obliged to consent to take another husband after the time should
have expired which she had promised to wait. A week before the last
day, Torello learned that the ship which carried his letter had been
wrecked, and the thought that his wife would now marry again drove him
almost mad. Saladin extracted from him the cause of his distress, and
promised that he should yet be at home before the time was out, which
Torello, who had heard that such things had often been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-198" id="Pg_1-198">[Pg 198]</a></span> done, was
ready to believe. And in fact, by means of one of his necromancers,
Saladin caused Torello to be transported to Pavia in one night&mdash;the
night before the new nuptials. Torello appeared at the banquet the next
day in the guise of a Saracen, under the escort of an uncle of his, a
churchman, and at the right moment sent word to the lady that it was a
custom in his country for a bride to send her cup filled with wine to
any stranger who might be present, and for him to drink half and cover
the cup, and for her to drink the rest. To this the lady graciously
assented. Torello drank out most of the wine, dropped in the ring which
his wife had given him when they parted, and covered the cup. The lady,
upon lifting the cover, saw the ring, knew her husband, and, upsetting
the table in her ecstasy, threw herself into Torello's arms.</p>

<p>Tales of this description still maintain themselves in popular
tradition. 'Der Ring ehelicher Treue,' Gottschalk, Deutsche
Volksmärchen, <span class="smcap">II</span>, 135, relates how Kuno von Falkenstein, going
on a crusade, breaks his ring and gives one half to his wife, begging
her to wait seven years before she marries again. He has the adventures
of Henry of Brunswick, with differences, and, like Moringer, sings a
lay describing his own case. The new bridegroom hands him a cup; he
drops in his half ring, and passes the cup to the bride. The two halves
join of themselves.<a name="FNanchor_1_171" id="FNanchor_1_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> Other examples, not without variations and
deficiencies, in details, are afforded by 'Der getheilte Trauring,'

<p>A Picard ballad, existing in two versions, partly cited by Rathery in
the Moniteur Universel for August 26, 1853, tells of a Sire de Créqui,
who, going beyond seas with, his sovereign, breaks his ring and gives
half to his young wife; is gone ten years, and made captive by the
Turks, who condemn him to death on account of his adhesion to Christ;
and is transported to his château on the eve of the day of his doom.
This very day his wife is to take another husband, sorely against her
will. Créqui appears in the rags of a beggar, and legitimates himself
by producing his half of the ring (which, in a way not explained by
Rathery, has been brought back by a swan).</p>

<p>'Le Retour du Mari,' Puymaigre, Chants populaires messins, p. 20, has
also some traits of ballads of this class. A bridegroom has to go on a
campaign the very day of his nuptials. The campaign lasts seven years,
and the day of his return his wife is about to remarry. He is invited
to the wedding supper, and towards the close of it proposes to play
cards to see who shall have the bride. The guests are surprised. The
soldier says he will have the bride without winning her at cards or
dice, and, turning to the lady, asks, Where are the rings I gave you at
your wedding seven years ago? She will go for them; and here the story
breaks off.<a name="FNanchor_1_172" id="FNanchor_1_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>The same hard fortune is that of Costantino, a young Albanian, who
is called to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-199" id="Pg_1-199">[Pg 199]</a></span> service of his king three days after his marriage.
He gives back her ring to his wife, and tells her he must go to the
wars for nine years. Should he not return in nine years and nine days,
he bids her marry. The young wife says nothing, waits her nine years
and nine days, and then, since she is much sought for, her father
wishes her to marry. She says nothing, again, and they prepare for the
bridal. Costantino, sleeping in the king's palace, has a bad dream,
which makes him heave a sigh that comes to his sovereign's ear. The
king summons all his soldiers, and inquires who heaved that sigh.
Costantino confesses it was he, and says it was because his wife was
marrying. The king orders him to take the swiftest horse and make for
his home. Costantino meets his father, and learns that his dream is
true, presses on to the church, arrives at the door at the same time
as the bridal procession, and offers himself for a bride's-man. When
they come to the exchange of rings, Costantino contrives that his ring
shall remain on the bride's finger. She knows the ring; her tears burst
forth. Costantino declares himself as having been already crowned with
the lady.<a name="FNanchor_1_173" id="FNanchor_1_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> Camarda, Appendice al Saggio di Grammatologia, etc.,

<p>With this belongs a ballad, very common in Greece, which, however,
has for the most part lost even more of what was in all probability
the original catastrophe. '<a title="[Greek: Anagnôrismos]">&#913;&#957;&#945;&#947;&#957;&#969;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#956;&#959;&#962;</a>,' Chasiotis, Popular
Songs of Epirus, p. 88, No 27, comes nearer the common story than other
versions.<a name="FNanchor_1_174" id="FNanchor_1_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> A man who had been twelve years a slave after being a
bridegroom of three days, dreams that his wife is marrying, runs to
the cellar, and begins to sing dirges. The king hears, and is moved.
"If it is one of the servants, increase his pay; if a slave, set him
free." The slave tells his story (in three lines); the king bids him
take a swift gray. The slave asks the horses, which is a swift gray.
Only one answers, an old steed with forty wounds. "I am a swift gray;
tie two or three handkerchiefs around your head, and tie yourself to my
back!"<a name="FNanchor_1_175" id="FNanchor_1_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> He comes upon his father pruning the vineyard. "Whose sheep
are those feeding in the meadows?" "My lost son's." He comes to his
mother. "What bride are they marrying?" "My lost son's." "Shall I get
to them in church while they are crowning?" "If you have a fast horse,
you will find them crowning; if you have a bad horse, you will find
them at table." He finds them at church, and calls out, A bad way ye
have: why do ye not bring out the bride, so that strangers may give her
the cup? A good way we have, they answer, we who bring out the bride,
and strangers give her the cup. Then he takes out his ring, while he is
about to present the cup to the bride. The bride can read; she stands
and reads (his name), and bids the company begone, for her mate has
come, the first crowned.</p>

<p>In other cases we find the hero in prison. He was put in for thirty
days; the keys are lost, and he stays thirty years. Legrand, p. 326,
No 145; <a title="[Greek: Neoellênika Analekta]">&#925;&#949;&#959;&#949;&#955;&#955;&#951;&#957;&#953;&#954;&#945;

<span class="smcap">III</span>, 152, on reaching the church, he cries, "Stand aside,
gentlemen, stand aside, my masters; let the bride pour for me." She
pours him one cup and two, and exclaims (the ring which was dropped
into the cup having dropped out of the story), My John has come back!
Then they both "go out like candles." In Sakellarios they embrace and
fall dead, and when laid in the grave come up as a cypress and a citron
tree. In the Cretan ballad John does not dismount, but takes the bride
on to the horse and is off with her; so in the beautiful ballad in
Fauriel, <span class="smcap">II</span>, 140, No 11, '<a title="[Greek: HÊ HArpagê]">&#7977; &#7945;&#961;&#960;&#945;&#947;&#951;</a>,' "peut-être
la plus distinguée de ce recueil," which belongs with this group, but
seems to be later at the beginning and the end. Even here the bride
takes a cup to pour a draught for the horseman.</p>

<p>In Russia the ring story is told of Dobrynya and Nastasya. Dobrynya,
sent out shortly after his marriage to collect tribute for Vladimir,
requests Nastasya to wait for him twelve years: then she may wed again,
so it be not with Alesha. Twelve years pass. Alesha avows that he has
seen Dobrynya's corpse lying on the steppe, and sues for her hand.
Vladimir supports the suit, and Nastasya is constrained to accept this
prohibited husband. Dobrynya's horse [two doves, a pilgrim] reveals
to his master what is going on, and carries him home with marvellous
speed. Dobrynya gains admittance to the wedding-feast in the guise of
a merry-maker, and so pleases Vladimir with his singing that he is
allowed to sit where he likes. He places himself opposite Nastasya,
drops his ring in a cup, and asks her to drink to him. She finds
the ring in the bottom, falls at his feet and implores pardon.<a name="FNanchor_1_177" id="FNanchor_1_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>

<p>We have the ring employed somewhat after the fashion of these western
tales in Somadeva's story of Vidúshaka. The Vidyúdhárí Bhadrá, having
to part for a while with Vidúshaka, for whom she had conceived a
passion, gives him her ring. Subsequently, Vidúshaka obliges a rakshas
whom he has subdued to convey him to the foot of a mountain on which
Bhadrá had taken refuge. Many beautiful girls come to fetch water in
golden pitchers from a lake, and, on inquiring, Vidúshaka finds that
the water is for Bhadrá. One of the girls asks him to lift her pitcher
on to her shoulder, and while doing this he drops into the pitcher
Bhadrá's ring. When the water is poured on Bhadrá's hands, the ring
falls out. Bhadrá asks her maids if they have seen a stranger. They
say they have seen a mortal, and that he had helped one of them with
her pitcher. They are ordered to go for the youth at once, for he is
Bhadrá's consort.<a name="FNanchor_1_178" id="FNanchor_1_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

<p>According to the letter of the ballads, should the ring given Horn by
his lady turn wan or blue, this would signify that she loved another
man: but though accuracy would be very desirable in such a case,
these words are rather loose, since she never faltered in her love,
and submitted to marry another, so far as she submitted, only under
constraint. 'Horn Child,' sts 48, 71, agrees with the ballads as to
this point. We meet a ring of similar virtue in 'Bonny Bee-Hom,'
Jamieson's Popular Ballads, <span class="smcap">I</span>, 187, and Buchan's Ballads of
the North of Scotland, <span class="smcap">I</span>, 169.</p>

things would go. King Modun passed, with Wikel, in gay discourse of
the charms of Rimild. Horn called out to them insultingly, and Modun
asked who he was. Horn said he had formerly served a man of consequence
as his fisherman: he had thrown a net almost seven years ago, and had
now come to give it a look. If it had taken any fish, he would love it
no more; if it should still be as he left it, he would carry it away.
Modun thinks him a fool. (3984-4057, and nearly the same in 'Horn
Childe and Maiden Rimild,' 77-79). This is part of a story in the Gesta
Romanorum, of a soldier who loved the emperor's daughter, and went to
the holy land for seven years, after a mutual exchange of fidelity
for that time. A king comes to woo the princess, but is put off for
seven years, upon her alleging that she has made a vow of virginity
for so long. At the expiration of this term, the king and the soldier
meet as they are on the way to the princess. The king, from certain
passages between them, thinks the soldier a fool. The soldier takes
leave of the king under pretence of looking after a net which he had
laid in a certain place seven years before, rides on ahead, and slips
away with the princess. Gest. Rom., Oesterley, p. 597, No 193; Grässe,
<span class="smcap">II</span>, 159; Madden, p. 32; Swan, <span class="smcap">I</span>, p. lxv. A similar
story in Campbell's Tales of the West Highlands, <span class="smcap">I</span>, 281,
'Baillie Lunnain.' (Simrock, Deutsche Märchen, No 47, is apparently a
translation from the Gesta.) The riddle of the hawk, slightly varied,
is met with in the romance of Blonde of Oxford and Jehan of Dammartin,
v. 2811 ff, 3143 ff, 3288 ff (ed. Le Roux de Lincy, pp. 98, 109, 114),
and, still further modified, in Le Romant de Jehan de Paris, ed.
Montaiglon, pp. 55, 63, 111. (Le Roux de Lincy, Köhler, Mussafia, G.
Paris). 'Horn et Rimenhild,' it will be observed, has both riddles, and
that of the net is introduced under circumstances entirely like those
in the Gesta Romanorum. The French romance is certainly independent of
the English in this passage.</p></div>

in the romances. This contingency seems not to have been foreseen when
the ring was given: but it must be admitted that it was better for the
ring to change, to the temporary clouding of the lady's character, than
to have Horn stay away and the forced marriage go on.</p></div>

that the half ring was, or would have been, employed in the sequel by

of Brunswick's death. A ring is so used in a Silesian tradition, of
the general character of that of Henry the Lion, with the difference
that the knight is awakened by a cock's crowing: 'Die Hahnkrähe bei
Breslau,' in Kern's Schlesische Sagen-Chronik, p. 151. There is a

that women have long hair and short wits, and so does Brunswick in
Wyssenhere's poem, st. 89. Numerous as are the instances of these
long absences, the woman is rarely, if ever, represented as in the
least to blame. The behavior of the man, on the other hand, is in some
cases trying. Thus, the Conde Dirlos tells his young wife to wait
for him seven years, and if he does not come in eight to marry the
ninth. He accomplishes the object of his expedition in three years,
but stays fifteen, never writes,&mdash;he had taken an unnecessary oath
not to do that before he started,&mdash;and forbids anybody else to write,
on pain of death. Such is his humor; but he is very much provoked at

<p><b>B</b> can be traced in Banffshire, according to Christie, for more
than a hundred years, through the old woman that sang it, and her
forbears. <b>C a</b>, <b>D</b> were originally published by Allies
in the year 1845, in a pamphlet bearing the title The Jovial Hunter
of Bromsgrove, Horne the Hunter, and Robin Hood. No intimation as to
the source of his copy, <b>C b</b>, is given by Bell, i. e., Dixon.
Apparently all the variations from Allies, <b>C a</b>, are of the
nature of editorial improvements. <b>E a</b> is said (1857) to be
current in the north of England as a nursery song.</p>

<p>One half of <b>A</b>, the oldest and fullest copy of this ballad (the
second and fourth quarters), is wanting in the Percy MS. What we can
gather of the story is this. A knight finds a lady sitting in a tree,
<b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b> [under a tree, <b>E</b>], who tells him
that a wild boar has slain Sir Broning, <b>A</b> [killed her lord and
thirty of his men, <b>C</b>; worried her lord and wounded thirty,
<b>E</b>]. The knight kills the boar, <b>B-D</b>, and seems to have
received bad wounds in the process, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>; the boar
belonged to a giant, <b>B</b>; or a wild woman, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>.
The knight is required to forfeit his hawks and leash, and the little
finger of his right hand, <b>A</b> [his horse, his hound, and his
lady, <b>C</b>]. He refuses to submit to such disgrace, though in no
condition to resist, <b>A</b>; the giant allows him time to heal his
wounds, forty days, <b>A</b>; thirty-three, <b>B</b>; and he is to
leave his lady as security for his return, <b>A</b>. At the end of
this time the knight comes back sound and well,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-209" id="Pg_1-209">[Pg 209]</a></span> <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>,
and kills the giant as he had killed the boar, <b>B</b>. <b>C</b> and
<b>D</b> say nothing of the knight having been wounded. The wild woman,
to revenge her "pretty spotted pig," flies fiercely at him, and he
cleaves her in two. The last quarter of the Percy copy would, no doubt,
reveal what became of the lady who was sitting in the tree, as to which
the traditional copies give no light.</p>

<p>Our ballad has much in common with the romance of 'Sir Eglamour of
Artois,' Percy MS., Hales and Furnivall, <span class="smcap">II</span>, 338; Thornton
Romances, Camden Society, ed. Halliwell, p. 121; Ellis, Metrical
Romances, from an early printed copy, Bohn's ed., p. 527. Eglamour,
simple knight, loving Christabel, an earl's daughter, is required by
the father, who does not wish him well, to do three deeds of arms, the
second being to kill a boar in the kingdom of Sattin or Sydon, which
had been known to slay forty armed knights in one day (Percy, st. 37).
This Eglamour does, after a very severe fight. The boar belonged to a
giant, who had kept him fifteen years to slay Christian men (Thornton,
st. 42, Percy, 40). This giant had demanded the king of Sydon's
daughter's hand, and comes to carry her off, by force, if necessary,
the day following the boar-fight. Eglamour, who had been found by the
king in the forest, in a state of exhaustion, after a contest which had
lasted to the third or fourth day, and had been taken home by him and
kindly cared for, is now ready for action again. He goes to the castle
walls with a squire, who carries the boar's head on a spear. The giant,
seeing the head, exclaims,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Alas, art thou dead!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My trust was all in thee!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now by the law that I lieve in,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My little speckled hoglin,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Dear bought shall thy death be.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="source">Percy, st. 44.</p>

<p>Eglamour kills the giant, and returns to Artois with both heads. The
earl has another adventure ready for him, and hopes the third chance
may quit all. Eglamour asks for twelve weeks to rest his weary body.</p>

<p><b>B</b> comes nearest the romance, and possibly even the wood of Tore
is a reminiscence of Artois. The colloquy with the giant in <b>B</b>
is also, perhaps, suggested by one which had previously taken place
between Eglamour and another giant, brother of this, after the knight
had killed one of his harts (Percy, st. 25). <b>C</b> 11, <b>D</b> 9
strikingly resemble the passage of the romance cited above (Percy, 44,
Thornton, 47).</p>

<p>The ballad has also taken up something from the romance of 'Eger and
Grime,' Percy MS., Hales and Furnivall, <span class="smcap">I</span>, 341; Laing, Early
Metrical Tales, p. 1; 'Sir Eger, Sir Grahame, and Sir Gray-Steel,'
Ellis's Specimens, p. 546. Sir Egrabell (Rackabello, Isaac-a-Bell),
Lionel's father, recalls Sir Eger, and Hugh the Græme in <b>B</b> is of
course the Grahame or Grime of the romance, the Hugh being derived from
a later ballad. Gray-Steel, a man of proof, although not quite a giant,
cuts off the little finger of Eger's right hand, as the giant proposes
to do to Lionel in <b>A</b> 21.</p>

<p>The friar in <b>E</b> 1<sup>3</sup>, 4<sup>1</sup>, may be a corruption of Ryalas, or
some like name, as the first line of the burden of <b>E</b>, 'Wind
well, <i>Lion</i>, good hunter,' seems to be a perversion of 'Wind well
<i>thy horn</i>, good hunter,' in <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>.<a name="FNanchor_1_180" id="FNanchor_1_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> This part of the
burden, especially as it occurs in <b>A</b>, is found, nearly, in a
fragment of a song of the time of Henry VIII, given by Mr Chappell in
his Popular Music of the Olden Time, <span class="smcap">I</span>, 58, as copied from
"MSS Reg., Append. 58."</p>

<p>A terrible swine is a somewhat favorite figure in romantic tales. A
worthy peer of the boar of Sydon is killed by King Arthur in 'The
Avowynge of King Arthur,' etc., Robson, Three Early English Metrical
Romances (see st. xii). But both of these, and even the Erymanthian,
must lower their bristles before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-210" id="Pg_1-210">[Pg 210]</a></span> the boar in 'Kilhwch and Olwen,'
Mabinogion, Part iv, pp. 309-16. Compared with any of these, the "felon
sow" presented by Ralph Rokeby to the friars of Richmond (Evans, Old
Ballads, <span class="smcap">II</span>, 270, ed. 1810, Scott, Appendix to Rokeby, note M)
is a tame villatic pig: the old mettle is bred out.</p>

<p>Professor Grundtvig has communicated to me a curious Danish ballad
of this class, 'Limgrises Vise,' from a manuscript of the latter
part of the 16th century. A very intractable damsel, after rejecting
a multitude of aspirants, at last marries, with the boast that her
progeny shall be fairer than Christ in heaven. She has a litter of nine
pups, a pig, and a boy. The pig grows to be a monster, and a scourge to
the whole region.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He drank up the water from dike and from dam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ate up, besides, both goose, gris and lamb.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The beast is at last disposed of by baiting him with the nine
congenerate dogs, who jump down his throat, rend liver and lights, and
find their death there, too. This ballad smacks of the broadside, and
is assigned to the 16th century. A fragment of a Swedish swine-ballad,
in the popular tone, is given by Dybeck, Runa, 1845, p. 23; another,
very similar, in Axelson's Vesterdalarne, p. 179, 'Koloregris,' and
Professor Sophus Bugge has recovered some Norwegian verses. The Danish
story of the monstrous birth of the pig has become localized: the
Liimfiord is related to have been made by the grubbing of the Limgris:
Thiele, Danmarks Folkesagn, <span class="smcap">II</span>. 19, two forms.</p>

<p>There can hardly be anything but the name in common between the Lionel
of this ballad and Lancelot's cousin-german.</p>

KING ORFEO</h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Leisure Hour, February 14, 1880, No 1468: Folk-Lore from
Unst, Shetland, by Mrs Saxby, p. 109.</p></div>


<p>Mr Edmondston, from whose memory this ballad was derived, notes that
though stanzas are probably lost after the first which would give
some account of the king in the east wooing the lady in the west, no
such verses were sung to him. He had forgotten some stanzas after the
fourth, of which the substance was that the lady was carried off by
fairies; that the king went in quest of her, and one day saw a company
passing along a hill-side, among whom he recognized his lost wife.
The troop went to what seemed a great "ha-house," or castle, on the
hillside. Stanzas after the eighth were also forgotten, the purport
being that a messenger from behind the grey stane appeared and invited
the king in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-216" id="Pg_1-216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<p>We have here in traditional song the story of the justly admired
mediæval romance of Orpheus, in which fairy-land supplants Tartarus,
faithful love is rewarded, and Eurydice (Heurodis, Erodys, Eroudys)
is retrieved. This tale has come down to us in three versions:
<b><a href="#Version_19_A">A</a></b>, in the Auchinleck MS., dating from the beginning of the
fourteenth century, Advocates Library, Edinburgh, printed in Laing's
Select Remains of the Ancient Popular Poetry of Scotland, 'Orfeo
and Heurodis,' No 3; <b>B</b>, Ashmole MS., 61, Bodleian Library,
of the first half of the fifteenth century, printed in Halliwell's
Illustrations of Fairy Mythology, 'Kyng Orfew,' p. 37; <b>C</b>,
Harleian MS., 3810, British Museum, printed by Ritson, Metrical
Romancëes, <span class="smcap">II</span>, 248, 'Sir Orpheo.' At the end of the Auchinleck
copy we are told that harpers in Britain heard this marvel, and made
a lay thereof, which they called, after the king, 'Lay Orfeo.' The
other two copies also, but in verses which are a repetition of the
introduction to 'Lay le Freine,' call this a Breton lay.</p>

<p>The story is this (<b><a href="#Version_19_A">A</a></b>). Orfeo was a king [and so good a harper
never none was, <b>B</b>]. One day in May his queen went out to a
garden with two maidens, and fell asleep under an "ympe" tree. When
she waked she shrieked, tore her clothes, and acted very wildly. Her
maidens ran to the palace and called for help, for the queen would
go mad. Knights and ladies went to the queen, took her away, and put
her to bed; but still the excitement continued. The king, in great
affliction, besought her to tell him what was the matter, and what
he could do. Alas! she said, I have loved thee as my life, and thou
me, but now we must part. As she slept knights had come to her and
had bidden her come speak with their king. Upon her refusal, the king
himself came, with a company of knights and damsels, all on snow-white
steeds, and made her ride on a palfrey by his side, and, after he had
shown her his palace, brought her back and said: Look thou be under
this ympe tree tomorrow, to go with us; and if thou makest us any let,
we will take thee by force, wherever thou be. The next day Orfeo took
the queen to the tree under guard of a thousand knights, all resolved
to die before they would give her up: but she was spirited away right
from the midst of them, no one knew whither.</p>

<p>The king all but died of grief, but it was no boot. He gave his kingdom
in charge to his high steward, told his barons to choose a new king
when they should learn that he was dead, put on a sclavin and nothing
else, took his harp, and went barefoot out at the gate. Ten years he
lived in the woods and on the heath; his body wasted away, his beard
grew to his girdle. His only solace was in his harp, and, when the
weather was bright, he would play, and all the beasts and birds would
flock to him. Often at hot noon-day he would see the king of fairy
hunting with his rout, or an armed host would go by him with banners
displayed, or knights and ladies would come dancing; but whither they
went he could not tell. One day he descried sixty ladies who were
hawking. He went towards them and saw that one of them was Heurodis.
He looked at her wistfully, and she at him; neither spoke a word, but
tears fell from her eyes, and the ladies hurried her away. He followed,
and spared neither stub nor stem. They went in at a rock, and he
after. They alighted at a superb castle; he knocked at the gate, told
the porter he was a minstrel, and was let in. There he saw Heurodis,
sleeping under an ympe tree.</p>

<p>Orfeo went into the hall, and saw a king and queen, sitting in a
tabernacle. He kneeled down before the king. What man art thou? said
the king. I never sent for thee, and never found I man so bold as to
come here unbidden. Lord, quoth Orfeo, I am but a poor minstrel, and it
is a way of ours to seek many a lord's house, though we be not welcome.
Without more words he took his harp and began to play. All the palace
came to listen, and lay down at his feet. The king sat still and was
glad to hear, and, when the harping was done, said, Minstrel, ask of me
whatever it be; I will pay thee largely. "Sir," said Orfeo, "I beseech
thee give me the lady that sleepeth under the ympe tree." "Nay," quoth
the king,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-217" id="Pg_1-217">[Pg 217]</a></span> "ye were a sorry couple; for thou art lean and rough and
black, and she is lovely and has no lack. A lothly thing were it to
see her in thy company." "Gentle king," replied the harper, it were a
fouler thing to hear a lie from thy mouth." "Take her, then, and be
blithe of her," said the king.</p>

<p>Orfeo now turned homewards, but first presented himself to the steward
alone, and in beggar's clothes, as a harper from heathendom, to see
if he were a true man. The loyal steward was ready to welcome every
good harper for love of his lord. King Orfeo made himself known; the
steward threw over the table, and fell down at his feet, and so did all
the lords. They brought the queen to the town. Orfeo and Heurodis were
crowned anew, and lived long afterward.</p>

<p>The Scandinavian burden was, perhaps, no more intelligible to the
singer than "Hey non nonny" is to us. The first line seems to be Unst
for Danish</p>

<span class="i0">Skoven årle grön (Early green's the wood).<br /></span>

<p><b><a href="#Version_20_M">M</a>.</b> From Miss M. Reburn, as learned in County Meath,
Ireland, one stanza.</p></div>


<p>Two fragments of this ballad, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, were printed in the
last quarter of the eighteenth century; <b>C-L</b> were committed
to writing after 1800; and, of these, <b>E</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>J</b>,
<b>K</b> are now printed for the first time.</p>

<p><b>A-H</b> differ only slightly, but several of these versions are very
imperfect. A young woman, who passes for a leal maiden, gives birth
to two babes [<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, one, <b>H</b>, three], puts them
to death with a penknife, <b>B-F</b>, and buries them, or, <b>H</b>,
ties them hand and feet and buries them alive. She afterwards sees
two pretty boys, and exclaims that if they were hers she would treat
them most tenderly. They make answer that when they were hers they
were very differently treated, rehearse what she had done, and inform
or threaten her that hell shall be her portion, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>,
<b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>H</b>. In <b>I</b> the children are buried
alive, as in <b>H</b>, in <b>J a</b> strangled, in <b>J b</b> and
<b>L</b> killed with the penknife, but the story is the same down to
the termination, where, instead of simple hell-fire, there are various
seven-year penances, properly belonging to the ballad of '<a href="#Ballad_21">The Maid and
the Palmer</a>,' which follows this.</p>

<p>All the English ballads are in two-line stanzas.<a name="FNanchor_1_181" id="FNanchor_1_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>

<p>Until 1870 no corresponding ballad had been found in Denmark, though
none was more likely to occur in <b>Danish</b>. That year Kristensen,
in the course of his very remarkable ballad-quest in Jutland, recovered
two versions which approach surprisingly near to Scottish tradition,
and especially to <b>E</b>: Jydske Folkeviser, <span class="smcap">I</span>, 329, No
121 <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, 'Barnemordersken.' Two other Danish versions
have been obtained since then, but have not been published. <b>A</b>
and <b>B</b> are much the same, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-219" id="Pg_1-219">[Pg 219]</a></span> a close translation of <b>A</b>
will not take much more space than would be required for a sufficient
abstract.</p>

<p>A ballad is spread all over <b>Germany</b> which is probably a
variation of 'The Cruel Mother,' though the resemblance is rather
in the general character than in the details. <b>A</b>, 'Höllisches

<p>The story is nearly this in all. A herdsman, passing through a wood,
hears the cry of a child, but cannot make out whence the sound comes.
The child announces that it is hidden in a hollow tree, and asks to be
taken to the house where its mother is to be married that day. There
arrived, the child proclaims before all the company that the bride is
its mother. The bride, or some one of the party, calls attention to the
fact that she is still wearing her maiden-wreath. Nevertheless, says
the child, she has had three children: one she drowned, one she buried
in a dung-heap [the sand], and one she hid in a hollow tree. The bride
wishes that the devil may come for her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-220" id="Pg_1-220">[Pg 220]</a></span> if this is true, and, upon the
word, Satan appears and takes her off; in <b>B</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>J</b>,
with words like these:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Komm her, komm her, meine schönste Braut,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dein Sessel ist dir in der Hölle gebaut.' <b>J</b> 9.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A <b>Wendish</b> version, 'Der Höllentanz,' in Haupt and Schmaler,
<span class="smcap">I</span>, 290, No 292, differs from the German ballads only in this,
that the bride has already borne nine children, and is going with the
tenth.</p>

<p>A combination of <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>F</b> is translated
by Grundtvig, Engelske og skotske Folkeviser, No 43, p. 279, and
<b>I</b>, from the eighth stanza on, p. 282. <b>C</b> is translated
by Wolff, Halle der Völker, <span class="smcap">I</span>, 11, and Hauschatz, p.
223; Allingham's version (nearly <b>B a</b>) by Knortz, L. u. R.

<h4>LADY ANNE</h4>

<p>"This ballad was communicated to me by Mr Kirkpatrick Sharpe of Hoddom,
who mentions having copied it from an old magazine. Although it has
probably received some modern corrections, the general turn seems to be
ancient, and corresponds with that of a fragment [<b>B b</b>], which
I have often heard sung in my childhood." Minstrelsy of the Scottish
Border, <span class="smcap">III</span>, 259, ed. 1803.</p>

<p>Buchan, Gleanings, p. 90, has an additional stanza between 8 and 9 of
Scott's, whether from the old magazine or not, it would not be worth
the while to ascertain.</p>

<p><b><a href="#Version_21_B">B</a>.</b> Sharpe's Ballad Book, ed. Laing, p. 157.</p></div>


<p>The only English copy of this ballad that approaches completeness
is furnished by the Percy manuscript, <b>A</b>. Sir Walter Scott
remembered, and communicated to Kirkpatrick Sharpe, three stanzas, and
half of the burden, of another version, <b>B</b>.</p>

<p>There are three versions in <b>Danish</b>, no one of them very well
preserved. <b>A</b>,'Maria Magdalena,' is a broadside of about 1700,
existing in two identical editions: Grundtvig, No 98, <span class="smcap">II</span>,
530; <b>B</b>, <i>ib.</i>, was written down in the Färöe isles in 1848,
by Hammershaimb; <b>C</b> was obtained from recitation by Kristensen
in Jutland in 1869, Jydske Folkeviser, <span class="smcap">I</span>, 197, No 72,
'Synderinden.'</p>

<p>A <b>Färöe</b> version, from the end of the last century or the
beginning of this, is given in Grundtvig's notes, p. 533 ff.</p>

<p>Versions recently obtained from recitation in <b>Norway</b> are:
'Maria,' Bugge's Gamle Norske Folkeviser, No 18; <b>A</b>, p. 88;
<b>B</b>, p. 90, a fragment, which has since been completed, but only
two more stanzas printed, Grundtvig, <span class="smcap">III</span>, 889; <b>C</b>,
Bugge, p. 91. <b>D</b>, <b>E</b> are reported, but only a stanza or
two printed, Grundtvig, <span class="smcap">III</span>, 889f; <b>F</b>, printed 890 f,
and <b>G</b>, as obtained by Lindeman, 891: all these, <b>D-G</b>,
communicated by Bugge. <b>C</b>, and one or two others, are rather
Danish than Norwegian.</p>

<p>This is, according to Afzelius, one of the commonest of <b>Swedish</b>
ballads. These versions are known: <b>A</b>, "a broadside of 1798 and
1802," Grundtvig, <span class="smcap">II</span>, 531, Bergström's Afzelius, <span class="smcap">I</span>,
335; <b>B</b>, 'Magdalena,' Atterbom's Poetisk Kalender for 1816,
p. 20; <b>C</b>, Afzelius, <span class="smcap">II</span>, 229; <b>D</b>, Arwidsson,
<span class="smcap">I</span>, 377, No 60; <b>E</b>, Dybeck's Svenska Visor, Häfte 2, No
6, only two stanzas; <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>, "in Wiede's collection, in the
Swedish Historical and Antiquarian Academy;" <b>H</b>, "in Cavallius
and Stephens' collection, where also <b>A</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>G</b> are
found;" <b>I</b>, Maximilian Axelson's Vesterdalarne, p. 171; <b>J</b>,
'Jungfru Adelin,' E. Wigström's Folkdiktning, No 38, p. 76; <b>K</b>,
'Jungfru Maja,' Album utgifvet af Nyländingar, <span class="smcap">VI</span>, 227.
<b>A-F</b> are printed in Grundtvig's notes, <span class="smcap">II</span>, 533 ff, and
also some verses of <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>.</p>

<p>The ballad is known to have existed in <b>Icelandic</b> from a minute
of Arne Magnusson, who cites the line, "Swear not, swear not, wretched
woman," but it has not been recovered (Grundtvig, <span class="smcap">III</span>, 891,
note d).</p>

<p><b>Finnish</b>, 'Mataleenan vesimatka,' Kanteletar, ed. 1864, p. 240.</p>

<p>The story of the woman of Samaria, John, iv, is in all these blended
with mediæval traditions concerning Mary Magdalen, who is assumed to
be the same with the woman "which was a sinner," in Luke, vii, 37,
and also with Mary, sister of Lazarus. This is the view of the larger
part of the Latin ecclesiastical writers, while most of the Greeks
distinguish the three (Butler, 'Lives of the Saints,' <span class="smcap">VII</span>,
290, note). It was reserved for ballads, as Grundtvig remarks, to
confound the Magdalen with the Samaritan woman.</p>

<p>The traditional Mary Magdalen was a beautiful woman of royal descent,
who derived her surname from Magdalum, her portion of the great family
estate. For some of her earlier years entirely given over to carnal
delights, "unde jam, proprio nomine perdito, peccatrix consueverat
appellari," she was, by the preaching of Jesus, converted to a
passionate repentance and devotedness. In the course of the persecution
of the church at Jerusalem, when Stephen was slain and the Christians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-229" id="Pg_1-229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
widely dispersed, Mary, with Lazarus, her brother, Martha, and many
more, were set afloat on the Mediterranean in a rudderless ship, with
the expectation that they would find a watery grave. But the malice
of the unbelieving was overruled, and the vessel came safe into port
at Marseilles. Having labored some time for the christianizing of the
people, and founded churches and bishoprics, Mary retired to a solitude
where there was neither water, tree, nor plant, and passed the last
thirty years of her life in heavenly contemplation. The cave in which
she secluded herself is still shown at La Sainte Baume. The absence
of material comforts was, in her case, not so great a deprivation,
since every day at the canonical hours she was carried by angels to
the skies, and heard, with ears of the flesh, the performances of the
heavenly choirs, whereby she was so thoroughly refected that when
the angels restored her to her cave she was in need of no bodily
aliment. (Golden Legend, Græsse, c. 96.) It is the practical Martha
that performs real austerities, and those which are ascribed to her
correspond too closely with the penance in the Scandinavian ballads
not to be the original of it: "Nam in primis <i>septem</i> annis, glandibus
et radicibus herbisque crudis et <i>pomis</i><a name="FNanchor_1_182" id="FNanchor_1_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> silvestribus corpusculum
sustentans potius quam reficiens, victitavit.... Extensis solo ramis
arboreis aut viteis, lapide pro cervicali capiti superposito subjecto,
... incumbebat." (Vincent of Beauvais, Spec. Hist., ix, 100.)</p>

<p>The best-preserved Scandinavian ballads concur nearly in this account.
A woman at a well, or a stream, is approached by Jesus, who asks for
drink. She says she has no vessel to serve him with. He replies that if
she were pure, he would drink from her hands. She protests innocence
with oaths, but is silenced by his telling her that she has had three
children, one with her father, one with her brother, one with her
parish priest: Danish <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>; Färöe; Swedish
<b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>J</b>, <b>K</b>; Norwegian
<b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>. She falls at his feet, and
begs him to shrive her. Jesus appoints her a seven years' penance in
the wood. Her food shall be the buds or the leaves of the tree [grass,
worts, berries, bark], her drink the dew [brook, juice of plants],
her bed the hard ground [linden-roots, thorns and prickles, rocks,
straw and sticks]; all the while she shall be harassed by bears and
lions [wolves], or snakes and drakes (this last in Swedish <b>B</b>,
<b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>K</b>, Norwegian <b>A</b>). The
time expired, Jesus returns and asks how she has liked her penance.
She answers, as if she had eaten daintily, drunk wine, slept on
silk or swan's-down, and had angelic company [had been listening to
music].<a name="FNanchor_1_183" id="FNanchor_1_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> Jesus then tells her that a place is ready for her in
heaven.</p>

<p>The penance lasts eight years in Swedish <b>C</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>J</b>,
Norwegian <b>A</b>; nine in the Färöe ballad; fifteen in Danish
<b>B</b>; and six weeks in Danish <b>C</b>. It is to range the field in
Danish <b>A</b>, Swedish <b>F</b>; to walk the snows barefoot in the
Färöe ballad and Norwegian <b>B</b>; in Norwegian <b>D</b> to stand
nine years in a rough stream and eight years naked in the church-paths.</p>

<p>The names Maria, or Magdalena, Jesus, or Christ, are found in most of
the Scandinavian ballads. Swedish <b>E</b> has 'Lena (Lilla Lena);
Swedish <b>H</b> He-lena; <b>J</b>, Adelin; <b>K</b>, Maja. Norwegian
<b>A</b> gives no name to the woman, and Danish <b>A</b> a name only
in the burden; Norwegian <b>B</b> has, corruptly, Margjit. In Danish
<b>C</b>, Norwegian <b>B</b>, <b>G</b>, Jesus is called an <i>old</i> man,
correspondingly with the "old palmer" of English <b>A</b>, but the old
man is afterwards called Jesus in Norwegian <b>G</b> (<b>B</b> is not
printed in full), and in the burden of Danish <b>C</b>. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-230" id="Pg_1-230">[Pg 230]</a></span> Son is
exchanged for the Father in Swedish <b>D</b>.</p>

English <b>A</b> 6, 7:</p>

<p>The woman is said to have taken the lives of her three children in
Danish <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, and of two in Swedish <b>C</b>,
<b>D</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>J</b>, <b>K</b> (<b>B</b> also, where
there are but two in all), a trait probably borrowed from '<a href="#Ballad_20">The Cruel
Mother</a>.'</p>

<p>The seven years' penance of the Scandinavian ballads is multiplied
three times in English <b>A</b>, and four times in <b>B</b> and
in those versions of 'The Cruel Mother' which have been affected
by the present ballad (20, <b>I</b>, <b>J</b>, <b>K</b>; <b>L</b>
is defective). What is more important, the penance in the English
ballads is completely different in kind, consisting not in exaggerated
austerities, but partly, at least, in transmigration or metensomatosis:
seven years to be a fish, 20, <b>I</b>, <b>J</b>, <b>K</b>; seven
years a bird, 20, <b>I</b>, <b>J</b>, <b>K</b>; seven years a stone,
21, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>; seven years an eel, 20, <b>J</b>; seven years
a bell, or bell-clapper, 20, <b>I</b>, 21, <b>A</b> (to ring a bell,
20, <b>K</b>, <b>L</b>). Seven years in hell seems to have been part
of the penance or penalty in every case: seven years a porter in hell,
21, <b>B</b>, 20, <b>I</b>, <b>K</b>; seven years down in hell, 20,
<b>J</b>; seven years to "ring the bell and see sic sights as ye darna
tell, 20, <b>L</b>;" "other seven to lead an ape in hell," <b>A</b>, a
burlesque variation of the portership.</p>

<p>The Finnish Mataleena, going to the well for water, sees the reflection
of her face, and bewails her lost charms. Jesus begs a drink: she says
she has no can, no glass. He bids her confess. "Where are your three
boys? One you threw into the fire, one into the water, and one you
buried in the wilderness." She fills a pail with her tears, washes his
feet, and wipes them with her hair: then asks for penance. "Put me,
Lord Jesus, where you will. Make me a ladder-bridge over the sea, a
brand in the fire, a coal in the furnace."</p>

<p>There are several Slavic ballads which blend the story of the
Samaritan woman and that of 'The Cruel Mother,' without admixture of
the Magdalen. <b>Wendish</b> <b>A,</b> 'Aria' (M-aria?), Haupt and
Schmaler, <span class="smcap">I</span>, 287, No 290, has a maid Who goes for water on
Sunday morning, and is joined by an old man who asks for a drink. She
says the water is not clean; it is dusty and covered with leaves. He
says, The water is clean, but you are unclean. She demands proof, and
he bids her go to church in her maiden wreath. This she does. The grass
withers before her, a track of blood follows her, and in the churchyard
there come to her nine headless boys, who say, Nine sons hast thou
killed, chopt off their heads, and meanest to do the same for a tenth.
She entreats their forgiveness, enters the church, sprinkles herself
with holy water, kneels at the altar and crosses herself, then suddenly
sinks into the ground, so that nothing is to be seen but her yellow
hair. <b>B</b>, 'Die Kindesmörderin,' <i>ib.</i>, <span class="smcap">II</span>, 149, No 197,
begins like <b>A</b>. As the maid proceeds to the church, nine graves
open before her, and nine souls follow her into the church. The oldest
of her children springs upon her and breaks her neck, saying, "Mother,
here is thy reward. Nine of us didst thou kill."</p>

<p>There are two <b>Moravian</b> ballads of the same tenor: <b>A</b>,
Deutsches Museum, 1855, <span class="smcap">I</span>, 282, translated by M. Klapp:
<b>B</b>, communicated to the Zeitschrift des böhmischen Museums,
1842, p. 401, by A.W. &#352;embera, as sung by the "mährisch sprechenden
Slawen" in Prussian Silesia; the first seven stanzas translated in
Haupt u. Schmaler, <span class="smcap">II</span>, 314, note to No 197. The Lord God goes
out one Sunday morning, and meets a maid, whom he asks for water. She
says the water is not clean. He replies that it is cleaner than she;
for (<b>A</b>)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-231" id="Pg_1-231">[Pg 231]</a></span> she has seduced fifteen men and had children with all
of them, has filled hell with the men and the sea with the children.
He sends her to church; but, as she enters the church-yard, the bells
begin to ring (of themselves), and when she enters the church, all the
images turn their backs. As she falls on her knees, she is changed into
a pillar of salt.</p>

<p>The popular ballads of some of the southern nations give us the legend
of the Magdalen without mixture.</p>

<p><b>French.</b> <b>A</b>, Poésies populaires de la France, <span class="smcap">I</span>
(not paged), from Sermoyer, Ain, thirty lines, made stanzas by
repetition. Mary goes from door to door seeking Jesus. He asks what she
wants: she answers, To be shriven. Her sins have been such, she says,
that the earth ought not to bear her up, the trees that see her can but
tremble. For penance she is to stay seven years in the woods of Baume,
eat the roots of the trees, drink the dew, and sleep under a juniper.
Jesus comes to inquire about her when this space has expired. She says
she is well, but her hands, once white as flower-de-luce, are now black
as leather. For this Jesus requires her to stay seven years longer, and
then, being thoroughly cured of her old vanities, she is told,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Marie Magdeleine, allez au paradis;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">La porte en est ouverte depuis hier à midi.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><b>B</b> is nearly the same legend in Provençal: Damase Arbaud,
<span class="smcap">I</span>, 64. The penance is seven years in a cave, at the end of
which Jesus passes, and asks Mary what she has had to eat and drink.
"Wild roots, and not always them; muddy water, and not always that."
The conclusion is peculiar. Mary expresses a wish to wash her hands.
Jesus pricks the rock, and water gushes out. She bewails the lost
beauty of her hands, and is remanded to the cavern for another seven
years. Upon her exclaiming at the hardship, Jesus tells her that Martha
shall come to console her, the wood-dove fetch her food, the birds
drink. But Mary is not reconciled:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Lord God, my good father,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Make me not go back again!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the tears from my eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I will wash my hands clean.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'With the tears from my eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I will wash your feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then I will dry them<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With the hair of my head.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><b>C</b>, Poésies populaires de la Gascogne, Bladé, 1881, p. 339; 'La
pauvre Madeleine,' seventeen stanzas of four short lines, resembles
<b>B</b> till the close. When Jesus comes back after the second
penance, and Mary says, as she had before, that she has lived like the
beasts, only she has lacked water, Jesus again causes water to spring
from the rock. But Mary says, I want no water. I should have to go back
to the cave for another seven years. She is conducted straightway to
paradise.</p>

<p><b>D</b>, Bladé, as before, p. 183, 'Marie-Madeleine,' six stanzas
of five short lines. Mary is sent to the mountains for seven years'
penance; at the end of that time washes her hands in a brook, and is
guilty of admiring them; is sent back to the mountains for seven years,
and is then taken to heaven.</p>

<p>A <b>Catalan</b> ballad combines the legend of the Magdalen's penance
with that of her conversion: Milá, Observaciones, p. 128, No 27, 'Santa
Magdalena,' and Briz y Saltó, Cansons de la Terra, <span class="smcap">II</span>, 99.
Martha, returning from church, asks Magdalen, who is combing her hair
with a gold comb, if she has been at mass. Magdalen says no, nor had
she thought of going. Martha advises her to go, for she certainly will
fall in love with the preacher, a young man; pity that he ever was a
friar. Magdalen attires herself with the utmost splendor, and, to hear
the sermon better, takes a place immediately under the pulpit. The
first word of the sermon touched her; at the middle she fainted. She
stripped off all her ornaments, and laid them at the preacher's feet.
At the door of the church she inquired of a penitent where Jesus was
to be found. She sought him out at the house of Simon, washed his feet
with her tears, and wiped them with her hair, picked up from the floor
the bones which he had thrown away. Jesus at last noticed her, and
asked what she wished.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-232" id="Pg_1-232">[Pg 232]</a></span> She wished to confess. He imposed the penance
of seven years on a mountain, "eating herbs and fennels, eating bitter
herbs." Magdalen turned homewards after the seven years, and found on
the way a spring, where she washed her hands, with a sigh over their
disfigurement. She heard a voice that said, Magdalen, thou hast sinned.
She asked for new penance, and was sent back to the mountain for seven
years more. At the end of this second term she died, and was borne to
the skies with every honor from the Virgin, saints, and angels.</p>

<h2><a name="Ballad_22" id="Ballad_22">22</a>
<br />
ST STEPHEN AND HEROD</h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Sloane MS., 2593, fol. 22 b; British Museum.</p></div>


<p>The manuscript which preserves this delightful little legend has
been judged by the handwriting to be of the age of Henry VI. It was
printed entire by Mr T. Wright, in 1856, for the Warton Club, under
the title, Songs and Carols, from a manuscript in the British Museum
of the fifteenth century, the ballad at p. 63. Ritson gave the piece
as 'A Carol for St Stephen's Day,' in Ancient Songs, 1790, p. 83, and
it has often been repeated; e. g., in Sandys' Christmas Carols, p. 4,
Sylvester's, p. 1.</p>

<p>The story, with the Wise Men replacing Stephen, is also found in the
carol, still current, of 'The Carnal and the Crane,' Sandys, p. 152,
in conjunction with other legends and in this order: the Nativity,
the Wise Men's passage with Herod, the Massacre of the Innocents, the
Flight into Egypt, Herod and the Sower.</p>

<p>The legend of Stephen and Herod occurs, and is even still living, in
Scandinavian tradition, combined, as in English, with others relating
to the infancy of Jesus.</p>

<p><b>Danish.</b> 'Jesusbarnet, Stefan og Herodes:' <b>A</b>, Grundtvig,
No 96, <span class="smcap">II</span>, 525. First printed in Erik Pontoppidan's little
book on the reliques of Paganism and Papistry among the Danish People,
1736, p. 70, as taken down from the singing of an old beggar-woman
before the author's door.<a name="FNanchor_1_184" id="FNanchor_1_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> Syv alludes to the ballad in 1695, and
cites one stanza. The first five of eleven stanzas are devoted to the
beauty of the Virgin, the Annunciation, and the birth of the Saviour.

<p><b>B.</b> A broadside of fourteen four-line stanzas, in two copies,
<b>a</b> of the middle, <b>b</b> from the latter part, of the last
century. <b>b</b> was printed "in the Dansk Kirketidende for 1862, No
43," by Professor George Stephens: <b>a</b> is given by Grundtvig,
<span class="smcap">III</span>, 881. The first three stanzas correspond to <b>A</b> 1-5,
the next three to <b>A</b> 6-8: the visit of the Wise Men to Herod is
then intercalated, 7-10, and the story concludes as in <b>A</b> 9-11.</p>

<p><b>C.</b> 'Sankt Steffan,' Kristensen, <span class="smcap">II</span>, 123, No 36, from
recitation about 1870, eight four-line stanzas, 1-3 agreeing with
<b>A</b> 3-6, 4-6 with <b>A</b> 6-9, 7, 8 with <b>A</b> 9, 11. The
verbal resemblance with the copy sung by the old beggar-woman more than
a hundred and thirty years before is often close.</p>

<p>A <b>Färöe</b> version, 'Rudisar vísa,' was communicated to the Dansk
Kirketidende for 1852, p. 293, by Hammershaimb, twenty-six two-line
stanzas (Grundtvig, <span class="smcap">II</span>, 519). Stephen is in Herod's service.
He goes out and sees the star in the east, whereby he knows that the
Saviour of the world, "the great king," is born. He comes in and makes
this announcement. Herod orders his eyes to be put out: so, he says, it
will appear whether this "king" will help him. They put out Stephen's
eyes, but now he sees as well by night as before by day. At this moment
a cock, roast and carved, is put on the board before Herod, who cries
out:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>Herod orders his horse and rides to Bethlehem, to find the new-born
king. As he comes in, Mary greets him, and tells him there is still
mead and wine. He answers that she need not be so mild with him: he
will have her son and nail him on the cross. "Then you must go to
heaven for him," says Mary. Herod makes an attempt on Jesus, but is
seized by twelve angels and thrown into the Jordan, where the Evil One
takes charge of him.</p>

<p><b>Swedish.</b> A single stanza, corresponding to Danish <b>A</b> 6,
<b>B</b> 4, <b>C</b> 4, is preserved in a carol, 'Staffans Visa,'
which was wont to be sung all over Sweden on St Stephen's day, in
the Christmas sport, not yet given up, called Staffansskede; which
consisted in young fellows riding about from house to house early in
the morning of the second day of Yule, and levying refreshments.<a name="FNanchor_1_185" id="FNanchor_1_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>
One of the party carried at the end of a pole a lighted lantern,
made of hoops and oiled paper, which was sometimes in the shape of a
six-cornered star. Much of the chant was improvised, and both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-235" id="Pg_1-235">[Pg 235]</a></span> the good
wishes and the suggestions as to the expected treat would naturally
be suited to particular cases; but the first stanza, with but slight
variations, was (Afzelius, <span class="smcap">III</span>, 208, 210):</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Stephen was a stable-groom,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We thank you now so kindly!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He watered the five foals all and some,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ere the morning star was shining.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">No daylight's to be seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The stars in the sky<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Are gleaming.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>or,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Stephen was a stable-groom,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Bear thee well my foal!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He watered the five foals all and some,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">God help us and Saint Stephen!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The sun is not a-shining,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But the stars in the sky<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Are gleaming.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There is also a Swedish ballad which has the substance of the story of
Danish <b>A</b> 6-8, but without any allusion to Stephen. It occurs
as a broadside, in two copies, dated 1848, 1851, and was communicated
by Professor Stephens to the Dansk Kirketidende, 1861, Nos 3, 4, and
is reprinted by Grundtvig, <span class="smcap">III</span>, 882 f, and in Bergström's
Afzelius, <span class="smcap">II</span>, 360 f. There are eleven four-line stanzas, of
which the last six relate how Mary was saved from Herod by the miracle
of the Sower (see 'The Carnal and the Crane,' stanzas 18-28). The first
five cover the matter of our ballad. The first runs:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In Bethlem of Judah a star there rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">At the time of the birth of Christ Jesus:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Now a child is born into the world<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That shall suffer for us death and torment.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Herod then calls his court and council, and says to them, as he says
to Stephen in the Danish ballad, "I cannot believe your story unless
the cock on this table claps his wings and crows." This comes to pass,
and Herod exclaims that he can never thrive till he has made that child
feel the effects of his wrath. He then steeps his hands in the blood
of the Innocents, and falls off his throne in a marvellous swoon. Mary
is warned to fly to Egypt. It is altogether likely that the person who
speaks in the first stanza was originally the same as the one who says
nearly the same thing in the three Danish ballads, that is, Stephen,
and altogether unlikely that Herod's words, which are addressed to
Stephen in the Danish ballads, were addressed to his court and council
rather than to Stephen here.</p>

<p><b>Norwegian.</b> Two stanzas, much corrupted, of what may have been a
ballad like the foregoing, have been recovered by Professor Bugge, and
are given by Grundtvig, <span class="smcap">III</span>, 883.</p>

<p>St Stephen's appearance as a stable-groom, expressly in the Swedish
carol and by implication in the Danish ballads, is to be explained by
his being the patron of horses among the northern nations.<a name="FNanchor_1_186" id="FNanchor_1_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> On
his day, December 26, which is even called in Germany the great Horse
Day, it was the custom for horses to be let blood to keep them well
during the year following, or raced to protect them from witches. In
Sweden they were watered "ad alienos fontes" (which, perhaps, is what
Stephen is engaged in in the carol), and treated to the ale which had
been left in the cups on St Stephen's eve; etc., etc.<a name="FNanchor_1_187" id="FNanchor_1_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> This way of
observing St Stephen's day is presumed to be confined to the north of
Europe, or at least to be derived from that quarter. Other saints are
patrons of horses in the south, as St Eloi, St Antony, and we must seek
the explanation of St Stephen's having that office<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-236" id="Pg_1-236">[Pg 236]</a></span> in Scandinavia,
Germany, and England in the earlier history of these regions. It was
suggested as long ago as the middle of the sixteenth century by the
Archbishop Olaus Magnus, that the horseracing, which was universal in
Sweden on December 26, was a remnant of heathen customs. The horse
was sacred to Frey, and Yule was Frey's festival. There can hardly
be a doubt that the customs connected with St Stephen's day are a
continuation, under Christian auspices, of old rites and habits which,
as in so many other cases, the church found it easier to consecrate
than to abolish.<a name="FNanchor_1_188" id="FNanchor_1_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<p>The miracle of the cock is met with in other ballads, which, for the
most part, relate the wide-spread legend of the Pilgrims of St James.</p>

<p><b>French.</b> In three versions, Chants de Pauvres en Forez et en
Velay, collected by M. Victor Smith, Romania, <span class="smcap">II</span>, 473 ff.
Three pilgrims, father, mother, and son, on their way to St James, stop
at an inn, at St Dominic. A maid-servant, enamored of the youth (qui
ressemble une image, que semblavo-z-un ange) is repelled by him, and
in revenge puts a silver cup [cups] belonging to the house into his
knapsack. The party is pursued and brought back, and the young pilgrim
is hanged. He exhorts his father to accomplish his vow, and to come
that way when he returns. When the father returns, after three [six]
months, the boy is found to be alive; his feet have been supported,
and he has been nourished, by God and the saints. The father tells the
judge that his son is alive; the judge replies, I will believe that
when this roast fowl crows. The bird crows: <b>A</b>, le poulet se mit
a chanter sur la table; <b>B</b>, le poulet vole au ciel, trois fois
n'a battu l'aile; <b>C</b>, trois fois il a chanté, trois fois l'a
battu l'aile. The boy is taken down and the maid hanged.</p>

<p><b>Spanish.</b> <b>A</b>, Milá, Observaciones sobre la Poesia Popular,
p. 106, No 7, 'El Romero;' <b>B</b>, Briz, Cansons de la Terra,
<span class="smcap">I</span>, 71, 'S. Jaume de Galicia,' two copies essentially agreeing.
The course of the story is nearly as in the French. The son does not
ask his father to come back. It is a touch of nature that the mother
cannot be prevented from going back by all that her husband can say.
The boy is more than well. St James has been sustaining his feet, the
Virgin his head. He directs his mother to go to the alcalde (Milá),
who will be dining on a cock and a hen, and to request him politely to
release her son, who is still alive. The alcalde replies: "Off with
you! Your son is as much alive as this cock and hen." The cock began to
crow, the hen laid an egg in the dish!</p>

<p><b>Dutch.</b> 'Een liedeken van sint Jacob,' Antwerpener Liederbuch,
1544, No 20, Hoffmann, p. 26; Uhland, p. 803, No 303; Willems, p. 318,
No 133. The pilgrims here are only father and son. The host's daughter
avows her love to her father, and desires to detain the young pilgrim.
The older pilgrim, hearing of this, says, My son with me and I with
him. We will seek St James, as pilgrims good and true. The girl puts
the cup in the father's sack. The son offers himself in his father's
place, and is hanged. The father finds that St James and the Virgin
have not been unmindful of the pious, and tells the host that his son
is alive. The host, in a rage, exclaims, "That's as true as that these
roast fowls shall fly out at the door!"</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But ere the host could utter the words,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One by one from the spit brake the birds,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And into the street went flitting;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They flew on the roof of St Dominic's house,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where all the brothers were sitting.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The brothers resolve unanimously to go to the judicial authority in
procession; the innocent youth is taken down, the host hanged, and his
daughter buried alive.</p>

<p><b>Wendish.</b> Haupt und Schmaler, <span class="smcap">I</span>, 285, No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-237" id="Pg_1-237">[Pg 237]</a></span> 289, 'Der
gehenkte Schenkwirth.' There are two pilgrims, father and son. The host
himself puts his gold key into the boy's basket. The boy is hanged:
the father bids him hang a year and a day, till he returns. The Virgin
has put a stool under the boy's feet, and the angels have fed him. The
father announces to the host that his son is living. The host will not
believe this till three dry staves which he has in the house shall put
out green shoots. This comes to pass. The host will not believe till
three fowls that are roasting shall recover their feathers and fly out
of the window. This also comes to pass. The host is hanged.</p>

<p>A <b>Breton</b> ballad, 'Marguerite Laurent,' Luzel, <span class="smcap">I</span>,
<b>A</b>, p. 211, <b>B</b>, p. 215, inverts a principal circumstance in
the story of the pilgrims: a maid is hanged on a false accusation of
having stolen a piece of plate. This may be an independent tradition
or a corrupt form of the other. Marguerite has, by the grace of St
Anne and of the Virgin, suffered no harm. A young clerk, her lover,
having ascertained this, reports the case to the seneschal, who will
not believe till the roasted capon on the dish crows. The capon crows.
Marguerite goes on her bare knees to St Anne and to Notre-Dame du
Folgoat, and dies in the church of the latter (first version).</p>

<p>'Notre-Dame du Folgoat,' Villemarqué, Barzaz Breiz, p. 272, No 38, 6th
ed., is of a different tenor. Marie Fanchonik, wrongly condemned to be
executed for child murder, though hanged, does not die. The executioner
reports to the seneschal. "Burn her," says the seneschal. "Though
in fire up to her breast," says the executioner, "she is laughing
heartily." "Sooner shall this capon crow than I will believe you." The
capon crows: a roast capon on the dish, all eaten but the feet.</p>

<p>Religious writers of the 13th century have their version of the story
of the pilgrims, but without the prodigy of the cock. Vincent of
Beauvais, Speculum Historiale, 1. 26, c. 33, who bases his narrative
on a collection of the miracles of St James incorrectly attributed to
Pope Callixtus II,<a name="FNanchor_1_189" id="FNanchor_1_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> has but two pilgrims, Germans, father and son.
On their way to Compostella they pass a night in an inn at Toulouse.
The host, having an eye to the forfeiture of their effects, makes them
drunk and hides a silver cup in their wallet. Son wishes to die for
father, and father for son. The son is hanged, and St James interposes
to preserve his life.<a name="FNanchor_1_190" id="FNanchor_1_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> With Vincent agree the author of the Golden
Legend, following Callixtus, Graesse, 2d ed., p. 426, c. 99 (94), §
5,<a name="FNanchor_1_191" id="FNanchor_1_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> and Cæsarius Heisterbacensis, Dialogus Miraculorum, c. 58,
<span class="smcap">II</span>, 130, ed. Strange, who, however, does not profess to
remember every particular, and omits to specify Toulouse as the place.
Nicolas Bertrand, who published in 1515 a history of Toulouse, places
the miracle there.<a name="FNanchor_1_192" id="FNanchor_1_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> He has three pilgrims, like the French and
Spanish ballads, and the roast fowl flying from the spit to convince a
doubting official, like the Dutch and Wendish ballads.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-238" id="Pg_1-238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>

<p>But, much earlier than the last date, this miracle of St James had
become connected with the town of San Domingo de la Calzada, one of the
stations on the way to Compostella,<a name="FNanchor_1_193" id="FNanchor_1_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> some hours east of Burgos.
Roig, the Valencian poet, on arriving there in the course of his
pilgrimage, tells the tale briefly, with two roasted fowls, cock and
hen: Lo Libre de les Dones e de Conçells, 1460, as printed by Briz from
the edition of 1735, p. 42, Book 2, vv. 135-183. Lucio Marineo, whose
work, De las cosas memorables de España, appeared in 1530, had been at
San Domingo, and is able to make some addition to the miracle of the
cock. Up to the revivification, his account agrees very well with the
Spanish ballad. A roast cock and hen are lying before the mayor, and
when he expresses his incredulity, they jump from the dish on to the
table, in feathers whiter than snow. After the pilgrims had set out a
second time on their way to Compostella, to return thanks to St James,
the mayor returned to his house with the priests and all the people,
and took the cock and hen to the church, where they lived seven years,
and then died, leaving behind them a pair of the same snowy whiteness,
who in turn, after seven years, left their successors, and so on to
Marineo's day; and though of the infinite number of pilgrims who
resorted to the tomb each took away a feather, the plumage was always
full, and Marineo speaks as an eye-witness. (Edition of 1539, fol.
xliii.) Dr Andrew Borde gives nearly the same account as Marineo, in
the First Book of the Introduction of Knowledge, 1544, p. 202 ff, ed.
Furnivall.<a name="FNanchor_1_194" id="FNanchor_1_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

<p>Early in the sixteenth century the subject was treated in at least
two miracle-plays, for which it is very well adapted: Un miracolo di
tre Pellegrini, printed at Florence early in the sixteenth century,
D'Ancona, Sacre Rappresentazioni, <span class="smcap">III</span>, 465; Ludus Sancti
Jacobi, fragment de mystère provençale, Camille Arnaud, 1858.<a name="FNanchor_1_195" id="FNanchor_1_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

<p>Nicolas Bertrand, before referred to, speaks of the miracle as depicted
in churches and chapels of St James. It was, for example, painted by
Pietro Antonio of Foligno, in the fifteenth century, in SS. Antonio
e Jacopo at Assisi, and by Pisanello in the old church of the Tempio
at Florence, and, in the next century, by Palmezzano in S. Biagio di
S. Girolamo at Forlì, and by Lo Spagna in a small chapel or tribune
dedicated to St James, about four miles from Spoleto, on the way to
Foligno. The same legend is painted on one of the lower windows of St
Ouen, and again on a window of St Vincent, at Rouen. Many more cases
might, no doubt, be easily collected.<a name="FNanchor_1_196" id="FNanchor_1_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

<p>It is not at all surprising that a miracle performed at San Domingo de
la Calzada should, in the course of time, be at that place attributed
to the patron of the locality; and we actually find Luis de la Vega,
in a life of this San Domingo published at Burgos in 1606, repeating
Marineo's story, very nearly, with a substitution of Dominic for
James.<a name="FNanchor_1_197" id="FNanchor_1_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> More than this, this author claims for this saint, who,
saving reverence, is decidedly <i>minorum gentium</i>, the merit and glory
of delivering a captive from the Moors, wherein he, or tradition, makes
free again with St James's rightful honors. The Moor, when told that
the captive will some day be missing, rejoins, If you keep him as close
as when I last saw him, he will as soon escape as this roast cock will
fly and crow. It is obvious that this anecdote is a simple jumble of
two miracles of St James,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-239" id="Pg_1-239">[Pg 239]</a></span> the freeing of the captives, recounted in
Acta Sanctorum, <span class="smcap">VI</span> Julii, p. 47, § 190f, and the saving the
life of the young pilgrim.<a name="FNanchor_1_198" id="FNanchor_1_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

<p>The restoration of a roasted fowl to life is also narrated in Acta
Sanctorum, <span class="smcap">I</span> Septembris, p. 529, § 289, as occurring early in
the eleventh century (the date assigned to the story of the pilgrims),
at the table of St Stephen, the first king of Hungary. St Gunther was
sitting with the king while he was dining. The king pressed Gunther to
partake of a roast peacock, but Gunther, as he was bound by his rule to
do, declined. The king then ordered him to eat. Gunther bent his head
and implored the divine mercy; the bird flew up from the dish; the king
no longer persisted. The author of the article, without questioning the
reality of the miracle, well remarks that there seems to be something
wrong in the story, since it is impossible that the holy king should
have commanded the saint to break his vow.</p>

<p>But the prime circumstances in the legend, the resuscitation of the
cock, does not belong in the eleventh century, where Vincent and others
have put it, but in the first, where it is put by the English and
Scandinavian ballads. A French romance somewhat older than Vincent,
Ogier le Danois, agrees with the later English ballad in making the
occasion to be the visit of the Wise Men to Herod. Herod will not
believe what they say,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Se cis capon que ci m'est en présant<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Et se redrece à la perche en cantant.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="source">vv 11621-23.</p>

<p>And what he exacts is performed for his conviction.<a name="FNanchor_1_199" id="FNanchor_1_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> Nevertheless,
as we shall now see, the true epoch of the event is not the Nativity,
but the Passion.</p>

<p>The ultimate source of the miracle of the reanimated cock is an
interpolation in two late Greek manuscripts of the so-called Gospel
of Nicodemus: Thilo, Codex Apocryphus Novi Testamenti, p. cxxix f;
Tischendorf, Evangelia Apocrypha, p. 269, note 3. After Judas had tried
to induce the Jews to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-240" id="Pg_1-240">[Pg 240]</a></span> back the thirty pieces, he went to his
house to hang himself, and found his wife sitting there, and a cock
roasting on a spit before the coals. He said to his wife, Get me a
rope, for I mean to hang myself, as I deserve. His wife said to him,
Why do you say such things? And Judas said to her, Know in truth that I
have betrayed my master Jesus to evil-doers, who will put him to death.
But he will rise on the third day, and woe to us. His wife said, Do
not talk so nor believe it; for this cock that is roasting before the
coals will as soon crow as Jesus rise again as you say. And even while
she was speaking the words, the cock flapped his wings and crew thrice.
Then Judas was still more persuaded, and straightway made a noose of
the rope and hanged himself.<a name="FNanchor_1_200" id="FNanchor_1_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

<p>The Cursor Mundi gives its own turn to this relation, with the intent
to blacken Judas a little more.<a name="FNanchor_1_201" id="FNanchor_1_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> When Judas had betrayed Jesus, he
went to his mother with his pence, boasting of the act. "Hast thou sold
thy master?" said she. "Shame shall be thy lot, for they will put him
to death; but he shall rise again." "Rise, mother?" said Judas, "sooner
shall this cock rise up that was scalded yesternight."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Hardly had he said the word,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The cock leapt up and flew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Feathered fairer than before,<br /></span>

<p>A still different version existed among the Copts, who had their copies
of the apocryphal writings, and among them the gospel of Nicodemus.</p>

<p>The Copts say, according to Thévenot, "that on the day of the Supper a
roasted cock was served to our Lord, and that when Judas went out to
sell Jesus to the Jews, the Saviour commanded the cock to get up and
follow him; which the cock did, and brought back his report to our Lord
that Judas had sold him, for which service this cock shall be admitted
to paradise."<a name="FNanchor_1_202" id="FNanchor_1_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<p>The herald of the morn is described in other carols as making known
the birth of the Saviour to the animal creation, or the more familiar
members of it.</p>

<p>"There is a sheet of carols headed thus: '<span class="smcap">Christus natus est</span>,
Christ is born,' with a wood-cut ten inches high by eight and one
half inches wide, representing the stable at Bethlehem; Christ in the
crib, watched by the Virgin and Joseph; shepherds kneeling; angels
attending; a man playing on the bagpipes; a woman with a basket of
fruit on her head; a sheep bleating and an ox lowing on the ground; a
raven croaking and a crow cawing on the hay-rack; a cock crowing above
them; and angels singing in the sky. The animals have labels from their
mouths, bearing Latin inscriptions. Down the side of the wood-cut is
the following account and explanation: 'A religious man, inventing
the conceits of both birds and beasts, drawn in the picture of our
Saviour's birth, doth thus express them. The cock croweth <i>Christus
natus est</i>, Christ is born. The raven asked <i>Quando</i>, When? The crow
replied, <i>Hac nocte</i>, This night. The ox cryeth out, <i>Ubi, ubi?</i> Where,
where? The sheep bleated out, <i>Bethlehem</i>, Bethlehem. A voice from
heaven sounded, <i>Gloria in excelsis</i>, Glory be on high!'" London, 1701.

<p>A little Greek ballad, 'The Taking of Constantinople,' only seven lines
long, relates a miracle entirely like that of the cock, which was
operated for the conviction of incredulity. A nun, frying fish, hears
a voice from above, saying, Cease your frying, the city will fall into
the hands of the Turks. "When the fish fly out of the pan alive," she

Bergström's Afzelius, <span class="smcap">II</span>, 356: and for a description of the

<span class="smcap">II</span>, 521, note **. From Chambers' Book of Days, <span class="smcap">II</span>,
763 f, it appears that a custom, called a Stephening, was still
existing at the beginning of this century, of the inhabitants of the
parish of Drayton Beauchamp, Bucks, paying a visit to the rector on
December 26, and lightening his stores of all the bread, cheese and
ale they wanted. Chambers, again, in his Popular Rhymes of Scotland,
p. 168 f, gives a song closely resembling the Staffansvisa, which was
sung before every house on New Year's eve, in Deerness, Orkney, with
the same object of stimulating hospitality. Similar practices are known
in the Scottish Highlands: see Campbell, Tales of the West Highlands,
<span class="smcap">III</span>, 19, and Chambers, at p. 167 of the Popular Rhymes.</p></div>

their part, to understand a "Stephanum primum Helsingorum apostolum,"
who certainly did not see the star in the east. The peasantry in
Helsingland, we are told, make their saints' day December 26, too, and
their St Stephen is a great patron of horses. The misappropriation of

Compostella in the possession of relics of St James, and was amply
entitled to the honor of the miracle. Dr Andrew Borde, in his First
Book of the Introduction of Knowledge, says that an ancient doctor of
divinity at Compostella told him, "We have not one hair nor bone of
St. James; for St James the More and St James the Less, St Bartholomew
and St Philip, St Simon and Jude, St Bernard and St George, with
divers other saints, Carolus Magnus brought them to Toulouse." Ed.

his information, but certainly from no source so trustworthy as the
chronicle of Turpin. Besides other places in France, the body, or at
least the head, of St James was claimed by churches in Italy, Germany,
and the Low Countries. But the author of an old Itinerary of the
Pilgrims to Compostella asserts that James the Greater is one of four
saints who never changed his burial-place. See Victor Le Clerc in Hist.

In Father Merolla's Voyage to Congo, 1682, a reference to which I owe
to Liebrecht, there is a story of a stewed cock, which, on the whole,
justifies Luis de la Vega's scruple. This must have been introduced
into Africa by some missioner, and, when so introduced, the miracle
must have had an object, which it had lost before the tale came to
Father Merolla.

<p>
One of two parties at feud having marched upon the chief city of his
antagonist, and found all the inhabitants fled, the soldiers fell to
rifling the houses and killing all the living creatures they met, to
satisfy their hunger. "Amongst the rest they found a cock of a larger
size than ordinary, with a great ring of iron about one of his legs,
which occasioned one of the wisest among them to cry out, Surely this
cock must be bewitched, and it is not at all proper for us to meddle
with. To which the rest answered, Be it what it will, we are resolved
to eat it. For this end they immediately killed and tore it to pieces
after the manner of the negroes, and afterwards put it into a pot to
boil. When it was enough, they took it out into a platter, and two,
according to the custom, having said grace, five of them sat down to
it with great greediness. But before they had touched a bit, to their
great wonder and amazement, the boiled pieces of the cock, though
sodden, and near dissolved, began to move about and unite into the
form they were in before, and, being so united, the restored cock
immediately raised himself up, and jumped out of the platter upon the
ground, where he walked about as well as when he was first taken.
Afterwards he leaped upon an adjoining wall, where he became new
feathered all of a sudden, and then took his flight to a tree hard by,
where fixing himself, he, after three claps of his wings, made a most
hideous noise, and then disappeared. Every one may easily imagine what
a terrible fright the spectators were in at this sight, who, leaping
with a thousand Ave Marias in their mouths from the place where this
had happened, were contented to observe most of the particulars at a
distance." It appears that the brother of one of the two contending
parties was said to have had a very large cock, from whose crowing he
took auguries, but whether this was the same as the one restored to
life is not known. Churchill's Collection of Voyages and Travels, 1704,

<h2><a name="Ballad_23" id="Ballad_23">23</a>
<br />
JUDAS</h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>MS. B. 14, 39, of the thirteenth century, library of Trinity
College, Cambridge, as printed in Wright &amp; Halliwell's Reliquiæ
Antiquæ, <span class="smcap">I</span>, 144.</p></div>


<p>This legend, which has not been heretofore recognized as a ballad, is,
so far as is known, unique in several particulars. The common tradition
gives Judas an extraordinary domestic history,<a name="FNanchor_1_204" id="FNanchor_1_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> but does not endow
him with a sister as perfidious as himself. Neither is his selling his
Master for thirty pieces accounted for elsewhere as it is here, if it
may be strictly said to be accounted for here.</p>

<p>A popular explanation, founded upon John xii, 3-6, and current for six
centuries and more, is that Judas, bearing the bag, was accustomed
to take tithes of all moneys that came into his hands, and that he
considered he had lost thirty pence on the precious ointment which
had not been sold for three hundred pence, and took this way of
indemnifying himself.</p>

<p>A Wendish ballad, Haupt und Schmaler, <span class="smcap">I</span>, 276, No 284, has
the following story. Jesus besought hospitality for himself and his
disciples of a poor widow. She could give a lodg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-243" id="Pg_1-243">[Pg 243]</a></span>ing, but had no bread.
Jesus said he would care for that, and asked which of his disciples
would go and buy bread for thirty pieces of silver. Judas offered
himself eagerly, and went to the Jews' street to do his errand. Jews
were gaming, under a tub, and they challenged Judas to play. The
first time he won the stake, and the second. The third time he lost
everything. "Why so sad, Judas?" they say: "go sell your Master for
thirty pieces." We are to suppose Judas to have rejoined his company.
Jesus then asks who has sold him. John says, Is it I? and Peter,
and then Judas, to whom Jesus replies, Thou knowest best. Judas, in
remorse, runs to hang himself. The Lord bids him turn, for his sin is
forgiven. But Judas keeps on till he comes to a fir: "Soft wood, thou
fir, thou wilt not bear me." Further on, till he comes to an aspen.
"Hard wood, thou aspen, thou wilt bear me." So he hanged himself on the
aspen; and still the aspen shakes and trembles for fear of the judgment
day.</p>

<p>According to the ballads, then, Judas lost the thirty pieces at play,
or was robbed of them, with collusion of his sister. But his passionate
behavior in the English ballad, st. 9, goes beyond all apparent
occasion. Surely it was not for his tithe of the thirty pieces.</p>

<p>And why does he insist to Pilate on the very thirty pieces he had lost,
rejecting every other form of payment? The ballad-singer might answer,
So it was, and rest contented. Or perhaps he might have heard, and
might tell us by way of comment, that these pieces had for long ages
been destined to be "the price of him that was valued, whom they of the
children of Israel did value;" had been coined by Abraham's father for
Ninus, and been given by Terah to his son; had passed through various
hands to the Ishmaelites, had been paid by them as the price of Joseph,
and been repaid to Joseph by his brethren for corn in Egypt; thence
were transferred to Sheba, and in the course of events were brought by
the Queen of the South as an offering to Solomon's temple; when the
temple was despoiled by Nebuchadnezzar, were given by him to the king
of Godolia, and after the kingdom of Godolia had been fused in that of
Nubia, were brought as his tribute to the infant Jesus by Melchior,
king of the same, etc.<a name="FNanchor_1_205" id="FNanchor_1_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

<p>It is much to be regretted that the manuscript from which this piece
was taken has been for some years lost from Trinity College Library, so
that a collation of Wright's text has not been possible.</p>

<br />
BONNIE ANNIE</h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><b><a href="#Version_24_A">A</a>.</b> 'Bonnie Annie,' Kinloch's Ancient Scottish Ballads,
p. 123.</p>

<p><b><a href="#Version_24_B">B</a>.</b> 'The High Banks o Yarrow,' Motherwell's MS., p. 652.</p></div>


<p>Had an old copy of this still pretty and touching, but much disordered,
ballad been saved, we should perhaps have had a story like this. Bonnie
Annie, having stolen her father's gold and her mother's fee, and fled
with her paramour (like the maid in No 4), the ship in which she is
sailing encounters a storm and cannot get on. Annie is seized with
the pangs of travail, and deplores the absence of women (<b>B</b> 6,
7, <b>A</b> 9, 10; compare No 15, 21-26). The sailors say there is
somebody on board who is marked for death, or flying from a just doom.
They cast lots, and the lot falls on Annie,&mdash;a result which strikes us
as having more semblance of the "corrupted currents of this world" than
of a pure judgment of God. Annie, conscious only of her own guilt, asks
to be thrown overboard. Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-245" id="Pg_1-245">[Pg 245]</a></span> paramour offers great sums to the crew to
save her, but their efforts prove useless, and Annie again begs, or
they now insist, that she shall be cast into the sea with her babe.
This done, the ship is able to sail on; Annie floats to shore and is
buried there.</p>

<p>The captain of the ship is the guilty man in <b>A</b>, in <b>B</b> a
rich squire. <b>A</b> may exhibit the original plot, but it is just
as likely that the captain was substituted for a passenger, under
the influence of another ballad, in which there is no Annie, but a
ship-master stained with many crimes, whom the lot points out as
endangering or obstructing the vessel. See 'Brown Robyn's Confession,'
further on.</p>

<p>If the narrative in Jonah, i, is the ultimate source of this and
similar stories, it must be owned that the tradition has maintained
its principal traits in this ballad remarkably well. Jonah flies
from the presence of the Lord in a ship; the ship is overtaken by a
tempest;<a name="FNanchor_1_206" id="FNanchor_1_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> the sailors cast lots to know who is the guilty cause,
and the lot falls on Jonah; he bids the sailors take him up and cast
him into the sea; nevertheless the men row hard to bring the ship to
land, but cannot succeed; they throw Jonah into the water, and the
storm ceases.<a name="FNanchor_1_207" id="FNanchor_1_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

in the Golden Legend, Grässe, c. xcvi, 2, p. 409 ff, indicates a
belief that even a dead body might prejudice the safety of a ship. The
princess of Marseilles, in the course of a storm, has given birth to a
boy and expired. The sailors demand that the body shall be thrown into
the sea (and apparently the boy, too), for, they say, as long as it
shall be with us, this thumping will not cease. They presently see a
hill, and think it better to put off the corpse, <i>and the boy</i>, there,
than that these should be devoured by sea-monsters. Fear will fasten
upon anything in such a case.

<p>This piece was first printed by Buchan, in 1828, and all the copies
which have been recovered are of about that date. The device of a
lover's feigning death as a means of winning a shy mistress enjoys a
considerable popularity in European ballads. Even more favorite is a
ballad in which the <i>woman</i> adopts this expedient, in order to escape
from the control of her relations: see 'The Gay Goshawk,' with which
will be given another form of the present story.</p>

<p>A <b>Danish</b> ballad answering to our Feigned Lyke-Wake is preserved,
as I am informed by Professor Grundtvig, in no less than fourteen
manuscripts, some of them of the 16th century, and is still living
in tradition. Five versions, as yet unprinted, <b>A-E</b>, have been
furnished me by the editor of the Ballads of Denmark.</p>

<p><b>A</b>, from a manuscript of the sixteenth century. Young Herre Karl
asks his mother's rede how he may get the maid his heart is set upon.
She advises him to feign sickness, and be laid on his bier, no one to
know his counsel but the page who is to do his errands. The page bids
the lady to the wake that night. Little Kirstin asks her mother's leave
to keep wake over Karl. The wake is to be in the upper room of Karl's
house. The mother says, Be on your guard; he means to cheat you; but
Kirstin, neither listening to her mother nor asking her father, goes
to keep wake in the upper room. When she went in she could not see the
lights for her tears. She begged all the good people to pray for Karl's
soul, sat down by his head and made her own prayer, and murmured, While
thou livedst I loved thee. She lifted the cloths, and there lay Karl
wide awake and laughing. "All the devils in hell receive thy soul!" she
cried. "If thou livedst a hundred years, thou shouldst never have my
good will! "Karl proposed that she should pass the night with him. "Why
would you deceive me!" Kirstin exclaimed. "Why did you not go to my
father and betroth me honorably?" Karl immediately rode to her father's
to do this, and they were married.</p>

<p><b>B. a</b>, from MSS of 1610 and later, almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-248" id="Pg_1-248">[Pg 248]</a></span> identical with
<b>b</b>, 'Den forstilte Vaagestue,' Levninger, Part <span class="smcap">II</span>,
1784, p. 34, No 7.<a name="FNanchor_1_208" id="FNanchor_1_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> This version gives us some rather unnecessary
previous history. Karl has sued for Ingerlille three years, and had an
ill answer. He follows her to church one fine day, and, after mass,
squeezes her fingers and asks, Will you take pity on me? She replies,
You must ask my father and friends; and he, I have, and can get no
good answer. If you will give me your troth, we can see to that best
ourselves. "Never," she says. "Farewell, then; but Christ may change
your mind." Karl meets his mother on his way from church, who asks why
he is so pale. He tells her his plight, and is advised, as before,
to use craft. The wake is held on Karl's premises.<a name="FNanchor_1_209" id="FNanchor_1_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> Ingerlille,
in scarlet mantle, goes with her maids. She avows her love, but adds
that it was a fixed idea in her mind that he would deceive her. She
lifts up the white cloth that covers the face. Karl laughs, and says,
We were good friends before, so are we still. Bear out the bier, and
follow me to bed with the fair maid. She hopes he will have respect for
her honor. Karl reassures her, leaves her with his mother, rides to
Ingerlille's house, obtains her parents' approbation, and buys wine for
his wedding.</p>

<p><b>C</b>, from manuscripts of the sixteenth century. Karl is given out
for dead, and his pages ride to the convent to ask that his body may
be laid in the cloister. The bier is borne in; the prioress comes to
meet it, with much respect. The pages go about bidding maids to the
wake. Ellin asks her mother if she may go. (This looks as if there had
originally been no convent in the ballad.) Her mother tells her to
put on red gold and be wary of Karl, he is so very tricky. When Ellin
owns her attachment, Karl whispers softly, Do not weep, but follow me.
Horses were ready at the portal&mdash;<i>black</i> horses all!</p>

<p>Karl sprang from the bier, took Ellin, and made for the door. The
nuns, who stood reading in the choir, thought it was an angel that had
translated her, and wished one would come for them. Karl, with fifteen
men who were in waiting, carried Ellin home, and drank his bridal with
her.</p>

<p><b>D</b>, from recent oral tradition. As Karl lay in his bed, he said,
How shall I get the fair maid out of the convent? His foster-mother
heard him, and recommended him to feign death and bid the fair maid to
his wake. The maid asked her father's leave to go, but he said, Nay,
the moment you are inside the door he will seize you by the foot. But
when the page, who had first come in blue, comes back in scarlet, she
goes. She stands at Karl's head and says, I never shall forget thee; at
his feet, "I wished thee well;" at his side, "Thou wast my dearest."
Then she turns and bids everybody good-night, but Karl seizes her, and
calls to his friends to come drink his bridal. We hear nothing of the
convent after the first stanza.</p>

<p><b>E</b>, from oral tradition of another quarter. Karl consults his
mother how he shall get little Kirstin out of the convent, and receives
the same counsel. A page is sent to the convent, and asks who will come
to the wake now Herr Karl is dead? Little Kirstin, without application
to the prioress, goes to her mother, who does not forbid her, but warns
her that Karl will capture her as sure as she goes into the room.</p>

<p><b>F</b>, another copy from recent tradition, was published in 1875, in
Kristensen's Jyske Folkeviser, <span class="smcap">II</span>, 213, No 62, 'Vaagestuen.'
There is no word of a convent here. The story is made very short.
Kirsten's mother says she will be fooled if she goes to the wake. The
last stanza, departing from all other copies, says that when Kirsten
woke in the morning Karl was off.</p>

<p><b>G.</b> 'Klosterranet,' Levninger, <span class="smcap">I</span>, 23, No 4 (1780),
Danske Viser, <span class="smcap">IV</span>, 261, No 212, a very second-rate ballad, may
have the praise of preserving consistency and conventual discipline.
The young lady does not slip out to see her mother without leave asked
and had. It is my persuasion that the convent, with its little jest
about the poor nuns, is a later invention, and that <b>C</b> is a
blending of two different stories. In <b>G</b>, Herr Morten betroths
Proud Adeluds, who is more virtuous than rich. His friends object; her
friends do not want spirit, and swear that she shall never be his.
Morten's father sends him out of the country, and Adeluds is put into
a convent. After nine years Morten returns, and, having rejected an
advantageous match proposed by his father, advises with his brother,
Herr Nilaus, how to get his true love out of the cloister. The
brother's plan is that of the mother and foster-mother in the other
versions. Herr Nilaus promises a rich gift if Morten's body may be
buried within the cloister. From this point the story is materially the
same as in <b>C</b>.</p>

<p><b>H.</b> A copy, which I have not yet seen, in Rahbek's Læsning i
blandede Æmner (or Hesperus), <span class="smcap">III</span>, 151, 1822 (Bergström).</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>'Hertugen af Skage,' Danske Viser, <span class="smcap">II</span>, 191, No 88, has this
slight agreement with the foregoing ballads. Voldemar, the king's
youngest son, hearing that the duke has a daughter, Hildegerd, that
surpasses all maids, seeks her out in a convent in which she has taken
refuge, and gets a cold reception. He feigns death, desiring that his
bones may repose in the cloister. His bier is carried into the convent
church. Hildegerd lights nine candles for him, and expresses compassion
for his early death. While she is standing before the altar of the
Virgin, Voldemar carries her out of the church by force.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This, says Afzelius, 1814, is one of the commonest ballads in
<b>Sweden</b>, and is often represented as a drama by young people in
country places. <b>A a</b>, 'Herr Carl, eller Klosterrofvet,' Afzelius,
<span class="smcap">I</span>, 179, No 26, new ed. No 24; <b>b</b>, Afzelius, Sago-Häfder,
ed. 1851, <span class="smcap">IV</span>, 106. <b>B</b>, Atterbom, Poetisk Kalender for
1816, p. 63, 'Det Iefvande Liket.' <b>C</b>. Rancken, Några Prof af
Folksång, o. s. v., p. 13, No 4. These differ but slightly from Danish
<b>D</b>, <b>E</b>. All three conclude with the humorous verses about
the nuns, which in Rancken's copy take this rollicking turn:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And all the nuns in the convent they all danced in a ring;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Christ send another such angel, to take us all under his wing!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And all the nuns in the convent, they all danced each her lone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Christ send another such angel, to take us off every one!'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Bergström, new Afzelius, <span class="smcap">II</span>, 131, refers to another version in
Gyllenmärs' visbok, p. 191, and to a good copy obtained by himself.</p>

<p>An Icelandic version for the 17th century, which is after the
fashion of Danish <b>C</b>, <b>G</b>, is given in Íslenzk Fornkvæði,
<span class="smcap">II</span>, 59, No 40, 'Marteins kviða.' The lover has in all three a
troop of armed men in waiting outside of the convent.</p>

<p>Professor Bugge has obtained a version in Norway, which, however, is as
to language essentially Danish. (Bergström, as above.)</p>

<p>There is a very gay and pretty south-European ballad, in which the
artifice of feigning death is successfully tried by a lover after the
failure of other measures.</p>

<p><b>A.</b> <b>Magyar.</b> Arany and Gyulai, <span class="smcap">I</span>, 172, No
18, 'Pálbeli Szép Antal;' translated by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-250" id="Pg_1-250">[Pg 250]</a></span> Aigner, Ungarische
Volksdichtungen, p. 80, 'Schön Anton.' Handsome Tony tells his mother
that he shall die for Helen. The mother says, Not yet. I will build a
marvellous mill. The first wheel shall grind out pearls, the middle
stone discharge kisses, the third wheel distribute small change. The
pretty maids will come to see, and Helen among them. Helen asks her
mother's leave to see the mill. "Go not," the mother replies. "They
are throwing the net, and a fox will be caught." Tony again says he
must die. His mother says, not yet; for she will build an iron bridge;
the girls will come to see it, and Helen among them. Helen asks to see
the bridge; her mother answers as before. Tony says once more that he
shall die for Helen. His mother again rejoins, Not yet. Make believe to
be dead; the girls will come to see you, and Helen among them. Helen
entreats to be allowed to go to see the handsome young man that has
died. Her mother tells her she will never come back. Tony's mother
calls to him to get up; the girl he was dying for is even now before
the gate, in the court, standing at his feet. "Never," says Helen, "saw
I so handsome a dead man,&mdash;eyes smiling, mouth tempting kisses, and his
feet all ready for a spring." Up he jumped and embraced her.</p>

<p><b>B.</b> <b>Italian.</b> Ferraro, Canti popolari monferrini, p. 59, No
40, 'Il Genovese.' The Genoese, not obtaining the beautiful daughter
of a rich merchant on demand, plants a garden. All the girls come for
flowers, except the one desired. He then gives a ball, with thirty-two
musicians. All the girls are there, but not the merchant's daughter. He
then builds a church, very richly adorned. All the girls come to mass,
all but one. Next he sets the bells a ringing, in token of his death.
The fair one goes to the window to ask who is dead. The good people
("ra bun-ha gent," in the Danish ballad "det gode folk") tell her that
it is her first love, and suggest that she should attend the funeral.
She asks her father, who consents if she will not cry. As she was
leaving the church, the lover came to life, and called to the priests
and friars to stop singing. They went to the high altar to be married.</p>

<p><b>C.</b> <b>Slovenian.</b> Vraz, Narodne pe&#347;ni ilirske, p. 93,
'&#268;udna bolezen' ('Strange Sickness'); translated by Anastasius Grün,
Volkslieder aus Krain, p. 36, 'Der Scheintodte.' "Build a church,
mother," cries the love-sick youth, "that all who will may hear mass;
perhaps my love among them." The mother built a church, one and another
came, but not his love. "Dig a well, mother, that those who will may
fetch water; perhaps my love among them." The well was dug, one and
another came for water, but not his love. "Say I am dead, mother, that
those who will may come to pray." Those who wished came, his love first
of all. The youth was peeping through the window. "What kind of dead
man is this, that stretches his arms for an embrace, and puts out his
mouth for a kiss?"</p>

THE THREE RAVENS</h2>

Appendix, p. xviii, No <span class="smcap">XII</span>.</p></div>


<p><b>a</b> was printed from Melismata, by Ritson, in his Ancient Songs,
1790, p. 155. Mr. Chappell remarked, about 1855, Popular Music of the
Olden Time, <span class="smcap">I</span>, 59, that this ballad was still so popular in
some parts of the country that he had "been favored with a variety
of copies of it, written down from memory, and all differing in some
respects, both as to words and tune, but with sufficient resemblance
to prove a similar origin." Motherwell, Minstrelsy, Introduction, p.
lxxvii, note 49, says he had met with several copies almost the same as
<b>a.</b> <b>b</b> is the first stanza of one of these (traditional)
versions, "very popular in Scotland."</p>

<p>The following verses, first printed in the Minstrelsy of the Scottish
Border, and known in several versions in Scotland, are treated by
Motherwell and others as a traditionary form of 'The Three Ravens.'
They are, however, as Scott says, "rather a counterpart than a copy of
the other," and sound something like a cynical variation of the tender
little English ballad. Dr Rimbault (Notes and Queries, Ser. <span class="smcap">V</span>,
<span class="smcap">III</span>, 518) speaks of unprinted copies taken down by Mr Blaikie
and by Mr Thomas Lyle of Airth.</p>

<p>This ballad, if it ever were one, seems not to have been met with, or
at least to have been thought worth notice, by anybody but Motherwell.
As already observed in the preface to '<a href="#Ballad_17">Hind Horn</a>,' stanza 2 seems to
have slipped into that ballad, in consequence of the resemblance of
stanza 1 to <b>F</b> 2, <b>H</b> 3 of 'Hind Horn.' This first stanza

<p>Motherwell informs us, Minstrelsy, p. xciv of Introduction, note to

various sets of it are to be found traditionally current (1827).
Still I have not found it, out of Maidment's little book; not even in

<br />
THE BOY AND THE MANTLE</h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Percy MS., p. 284. Hales &amp; Furnivall, II, 304.</p></div>


<p>This ballad and the two which follow it are clearly not of the same
rise, and not meant for the same ears, as those which go before. They
would come down by professional rather than by domestic tradition,
through minstrels rather than knitters and weavers. They suit the
hall better than the bower, the tavern or public square better than
the cottage, and would not go to the spinning-wheel at all. An
exceedingly good piece of minstrelsy 'The Boy and the Mantle' is, too;
much livelier than most of the numerous variations on the somewhat
overhandled theme.<a name="FNanchor_1_211" id="FNanchor_1_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>

<p>Of these, as nearest related, the fabliau or "romance" of Le Mantel
Mautaillié, 'Cort Mantel,' must be put first: Montaiglon et Raynaud,
Recueil Général des Fabliaux, III, 1, from four manuscripts, three
of the thirteenth century, one of the fourteenth; and previously by
Michel, from the three older manuscripts, in Wolf, Ueber die Lais,
p. 324. A rendering of the fabliau in prose, existing in a single
manuscript, was several times printed in the sixteenth century: given
in Legrand, ed. Renouard, I, 126, and before, somewhat modernized, by
Caylus, 'Les Manteaux,' &#338;uvres Badines, VI, 435.<a name="FNanchor_1_212" id="FNanchor_1_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p>The story in 'Cort Mantel' goes thus. Arthur was holding full court
at Pentecost, never more splendidly. Not only kings, dukes, and
counts were there, but the attendance of all young bachelors had been
commanded, and he that had a <i>bele amie</i> was to bring her. The court
assembled on Saturday, and on Sunday all the world went to church.
After service the queen took the ladies to her apartments, till dinner
should be ready. But it was Arthur's wont not to dine that day until
he had had or heard of some adventure;<a name="FNanchor_1_213" id="FNanchor_1_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> dinner was kept waiting;
and it was therefore with great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-258" id="Pg_1-258">[Pg 258]</a></span> satisfaction that the knights saw a
handsome and courteous varlet arrive, who must certainly bring news;
news that was not to be good to all, though some would be pleased
(cf. stanza 5 of the ballad). A maid had sent him from a very distant
country to ask a boon of the king. He was not to name the boon or the
lady till he had the king's promise; but what he asked was no harm. The
king having said that he would grant what was asked, the varlet took
from a bag a beautiful mantle, of fairy workmanship. This mantle would
fit no dame or damsel who had in any way misbehaved towards husband or
lover; it would be too short or too long; and the boon was that the
king should require all the ladies of the court to put it on.</p>

<p>The ladies were still waiting dinner, unconscious of what was coming.
Gawain was sent to require their presence, and he simply told them
that the magnificent mantle was to be given to the one it best fitted.
The king repeated the assurance, and the queen, who wished much to win
the mantle, was the first to try it on. It proved too short. Ywain
suggested that a young lady who stood near the queen should try. This
she readily did, and what was short before was shorter still. Kay, who
had been making his comments unguardedly, now divulged the secret, and
after that nobody cared to have to do with the mantle. The king said,
We may as well give it back; but the varlet insisted on having the
king's promise. There was general consternation and bad humor.</p>

<p>Kay called his mistress, and very confidently urged her to put on the
mantle. She demurred, on the ground that she might give offence by
forwardness; but this roused suspicion in Kay, and she had no resource
but to go on. The mantle was again lamentably short. Bruns and Ydier
let loose some gibes. Kay bade them wait; he had hopes for them.
Gawain's <i>amie</i> next underwent the test, then Ywain's, then Perceval's.
Still a sad disappointment. Many were the curses on the mantle that
would fit nobody, and on him that brought it. Kay takes the unlucky
ladies, one after the other, to sit with his mistress.</p>

<p>At this juncture Kay proposes that they shall have dinner, and continue
the experiment by and by. The varlet is relentless; but Kay has the
pleasure of seeing Ydier discomfited. And so they go on through the
whole court, till the varlet says that he fears he shall be obliged to
carry his mantle away with him. But first let the chambers be searched;
some one may be in hiding who may save the credit of the court. The
king orders a search, and they find one lady, not in hiding, but in
her bed, because she is not well. Being told that she must come, she
presents herself as soon as she can dress, greatly to the vexation of
her lover, whose name is Carados Briebras. The varlet explains to her
the quality of the mantle, and Carados, in verses very honorable to his
heart, begs that she will not put it on if she has any misgivings.<a name="FNanchor_1_214" id="FNanchor_1_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>
The lady says very meekly that she dare not boast being better than
other people, but, if it so please her lord, she will willingly don the
mantle. This she does, and in sight of all the barons it is neither too
short nor too long. "It was well we sent for her," says the varlet.
"Lady, your lover ought to be delighted. I have carried this mantle to
many courts, and of more than a thousand who have put it on you are
the only one that has escaped disgrace. I give it to you, and well you
deserve it." The king confirms the gift, and no one can gainsay.</p>

<p>A Norse prose translation of the French fabliau was executed by order
of the Norwegian king, Hákon Hákonarson, whose reign covers the years
1217-63. Of this translation, 'Möttuls Saga,' a fragment has come
down which is as old as 1300; there are also portions of a manuscript
which is assigned to about 1400, and two transcripts of this latter,
made when it was complete, besides other less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-259" id="Pg_1-259">[Pg 259]</a></span> important copies.
This translation, which is reasonably close and was made from a good
exemplar, has been most excellently edited by Messrs Cederschiöld and
Wulff, Versions nordiques du Fabliau Le Mantel Mautaillié, Lund, 1877,
p. 1.<a name="FNanchor_1_215" id="FNanchor_1_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> It presents no divergences from the story as just given
which are material here.</p>

<p>Not so with the 'Skikkju Rímur,' or Mantle Rhymes, an Icelandic
composition of the fifteenth century, in three parts, embracing in all
one hundred and eighty-five four-line stanzas: Cederschiöld and Wulff,
p. 51. In these the story is told with additions, which occur partially
in our ballad. The mantle is of white velvet. Three elf-women had been
not less than fifteen years in weaving it, and it seemed both yellow
and gray, green and black, red and blue: <span class="smcap">II</span>, 22, 23, 26. Our
English minstrel describes these variations of color as occurring after
Guenever had put the mantle on: stanzas 11, 12. Again, there are among
the Pentecostal guests a king and queen of Dwarf Land; a beardless
king of Small-Maids Land, with a queen eight years old; and a King
Felix, three hundred years old, with a beard to the crotch, and a wife,
tall and fat, to whom he has been two centuries married,&mdash;all these
severally attended by generous retinues of pigmies, juveniles, and
seniors: <span class="smcap">I</span>, 28-35; <span class="smcap">III</span>, 41. Felix is of course the
prototype of the old knight pattering over a creed in stanzas 21-24 of
the ballad, and he will have his representative in several other pieces
presently to be spoken of. In the end Arthur sends all the ladies from
his court in disgrace, and his knights to the wars; we will get better
wives, he says: <span class="smcap">III</span>, 74, 75.</p>

<p>The land of Small-Maids and the long-lived race are mentioned in
a brief geographical chapter (the thirteenth) of that singular
gallimaufry the saga of Samson the Fair, but not in connection with a
probation by the mantle, though this saga has appropriated portions
of the story. Here the mantle is one which four fairies have worked
at for eighteen years, as a penalty for stealing from the fleece of
a very remarkable ram; and it is of this same fleece, described as
being of all hues, gold, silk, <i>ok kolors</i>, that the mantle is woven.
It would hold off from an unchaste woman and fall off from a thief.
Quintalin, to ransom his life, undertakes to get the mantle for Samson.
Its virtue is tried at two weddings, the second being Samson's; and on
this last occasion Valentina, Samson's bride, is the only woman who
can put it on. The mantle is given to Valentina, as in the fabliau to
Carados's wife, but nevertheless we hear later of its being presented
by Samson to another lady, who, a good while after, was robbed of the
same by a pirate, and the mantle carried to Africa. From Africa it was
sent to our Arthur by a lady named Elida, "and hence the saga of the
mantle."<a name="FNanchor_1_216" id="FNanchor_1_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> Björner, Nordiska Kämpa Dater, cc 12, 14, 15, 21, 22, 24.</p>

<p>There is also an incomplete German version of the fabliau, now credibly
shown to be the work of Heinrich von dem Türlin, dating from the
earliest years of the thirteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_1_217" id="FNanchor_1_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> Though the author has
dealt freely with his original, there are indications that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-260" id="Pg_1-260">[Pg 260]</a></span> this, like
the Möttulssaga, was founded upon some version of the fabliau which
is not now extant. One of these is an agreement between vv 574-6 and
the sixth stanza of our ballad. The mantle, in English, is enclosed
between two nut-shells;<a name="FNanchor_1_218" id="FNanchor_1_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> in German, the bag from which it is taken
is hardly a span wide. In the Möttulssaga, p. 9, l. 6, the mantle
comes from a púss, a small bag hanging on the belt; in Ulrich von
Zatzikhoven's Lanzelet, from ein mæzigez teschelîn, and in the latter
case the mantle instantaneously expands to full size (Warnatsch); it is
also of all colors known to man, vv 5807-19. Again, when Guenever had
put on the mantle, st. 10 of our ballad, "it was from the top to the
toe as sheeres had itt shread." So in 'Der Mantel,' vv 732, 733:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Unde [== unten] het man in zerizzen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oder mit mezzern zesnitten.<a name="FNanchor_1_219" id="FNanchor_1_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Lanzelet of Ulrich von Zatzikhoven, dating from the first years of
the thirteenth century, with peculiarities of detail and a partially
new set of names, presents the outline of the same story. A sea-fairy
sends a maid to Arthur with a magnificent gift, which is, however,
conditioned upon his granting a boon. Arthur assents, and the maid
takes, from a small bag which she wears at her girdle, a mantle, which
is of all colors that man ever saw or heard of, and is worked with
every manner of beast, fowl, and strange fish. The king's promise
obliges him to make all the court ladies don the mantle, she to have
it whom it perfectly fits. More than two hundred try, and there is no
absolute fit.<a name="FNanchor_1_220" id="FNanchor_1_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> But Iblis, Lanzelet's wife, is not present: she
is languishing on account of his absence on a dangerous adventure.
She is sent for, and by general agreement the mantle is, on her, the
best-fitting garment woman ever wore. Ed. Hahn, vv 5746-6135.</p>

<p>The adventure of the Mantle is very briefly reported to Gawain, when
on his way with Ydain to Arthur, by a youth who had just come from
the court, in terms entirely according with the French fabliau, in
Messire Gauvain, ou La Vengeance de Raguidel, by the trouvère Raoul,
ed. Hippeau, p. 135 ff, vv 3906-55, and in the Dutch Lancelot, ed.
Jonckbloet, Part II, p. 85, vv 12,500-527, poems of the thirteenth
century. The one lady whom the mantle fits is in the latter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-261" id="Pg_1-261">[Pg 261]</a></span> Carados
vrindinne, in the other l'amie Caraduel Briefbras.</p>

<p>The Scalachronica, by Sir Thomas Gray of Heton, a chronicle of England
and Scotland, 1066-1362, begun in 1355, gives the analysis of many
romances, and that of the adventure of the Mantle in this form. There
was sent to Arthur's court the mantle of Karodes, which was of such
virtue that it would fit no woman who was not willing that her husband
should know both her act and her thought.<a name="FNanchor_1_221" id="FNanchor_1_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> This was the occasion of
much mirth, for the mantle was either too short, or too long, or too
tight, for all the ladies except Karodes' wife. And it was said that
this mantle was sent by the father of Karodes, a magician, to prove the
goodness of his son's wife.<a name="FNanchor_1_222" id="FNanchor_1_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></p>

<p>Two fifteenth-century German versions of the Mantle story give it a
shape of their own. In Fastnachtspiele aus dem fünfzehnten Jahrhundert,
II, 665, No 81, 'Der Luneten Mantel,' the amiable Lunet, so well
and favorably known in romances, takes the place of the English boy
and French varlet. The story has the usual course. The mantle is
unsuccessfully tried by Arthur's queen, by the wife of the Greek
emperor, and by the queen of Lorraine. The king of Spain, who announces
himself as <i>the oldest man</i> present, is willing to excuse his wife,
who is the youngest of the royal ladies. She says, If we lack lands
and gold, "so sei wir doch an eren reich," offers herself to the test
with the fearlessness of innocence, and comes off clear, to the delight
of her aged spouse. A meistergesang, Bruns, Beiträge zur kritischen
Bearbeitung alter Handschriften, p. 143,<a name="FNanchor_1_223" id="FNanchor_1_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> 'Lanethen Mantel,' again
awards the prize to the young wife of a very old knight. Laneth, a
clean maid, who is Arthur's niece, having made herself poor by her
bounty, is cast off by her uncle's wife and accused of loose behavior.
She makes her trouble known to a dwarf, a good friend of her father's,
and receives from him a mantle to take to Arthur's court: if anybody
huffs her, she is to put it to use. The queen opens upon Laneth, as
soon as she appears, with language not unlike that which she employs of
Cradock's wife in stanzas 33, 34 of the ballad. The mantle is offered
to any lady that it will fit. In front it comes to the queen's knee,
and it drags on the ground behind. Three hundred and fifty knights'
ladies fare as ill as the sovereign.<a name="FNanchor_1_224" id="FNanchor_1_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></p>

<p>The Dean of Lismore's collection of Gaelic poetry, made in the early
part of the sixteenth century, contains a ballad, obscure in places,
but clearly presenting the outlines of the English ballad or French
fabliau.<a name="FNanchor_1_225" id="FNanchor_1_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> Finn, Diarmaid, and four other heroes are drinking, with
their six wives. The women take too much, and fall to boasting of their
chastity. While they are so engaged, a maid approaches who is clad in
a seamless robe of pure white. She sits down by Finn, and he asks her
what is the virtue of the garment. She replies that her seamless robe
will completely cover none but the spotless wife. Conan, a sort of
Kay, says, Give it to my wife at once, that we may learn the truth of
what they have been saying.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-262" id="Pg_1-262">[Pg 262]</a></span> The robe shrinks into folds, and Conan is
so angry that he seizes his spear and kills his wife.<a name="FNanchor_1_226" id="FNanchor_1_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> Diarmaid's
wife tries, and the robe clings about her hair; Oscar's, and it does
not reach to her middle; Maighinis, Finn's wife, and it folds around
her ears. MacRea's wife only is completely covered. The 'daughter of
Deirg,' certainly a wife of Finn, and here seemingly to be identified
with Maighinis, claims the robe: she has done nothing to be ashamed of;
she has erred only with Finn. Finn curses her and womankind, "because
of her who came that day."</p>

<p>The probation by the Horn runs parallel with that by the Mantle, with
which it is combined in the English ballad. Whether this or that is
the anterior creation it is not possible to say, though the 'Lai du
Corn' is, beyond question, as Ferdinand Wolf held, of a more original
stamp, fresher and more in the popular vein than the fabliau of the
Mantle, as we have it.<a name="FNanchor_1_227" id="FNanchor_1_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> The 'Lai du Corn,' preserved in a single
not very early manuscript (Digby 86, Bodleian Library, "of the second
half of the thirteenth or beginning of the fourteenth century"), may
well belong, where Wolf puts it, in the middle of the twelfth. Robert
Bikez, the jongleur who composed it, attributes the first authorship
to "Garadue," the hero, and says that he himself derived the story
from the oral communication of an abbé. Arthur has assembled thirty
thousand knights at a feast at Pentecost, and each of them is paired
with a lady. Before dinner there arrives a donzel, with an ivory horn
adorned with four gold bands and rich jewels. This horn has been sent
Arthur by Mangounz, king of Moraine. The youth is told to take his
place before the king, who promises to knight him after dinner and
give him a handsome present the next day; but he laughingly excuses
himself, on the ground that it is not proper for a squire to eat at a
knight's table, and retires. Arthur sees that there is an inscription
on the horn, and desires that his "chapelein" may read it. Everybody
is eager to hear, but some repent afterwards. The horn was made by
a fairy, who endued it with this quality, that no man should drink
of it without spilling, if his wife had not been true in act and
thought. Even the queen hung her head, and so did all the barons that
had wives. The maids jested, and looked at their lovers with "Now we
shall see." Arthur was offended, but ordered Kay to fill. The king
drank and spilled; seized a knife, and was about to strike the queen,
but was withheld by his knights. Gawain gallantly came to the queen's
vindication. "Be not such a churl," he said, "for there is no married
woman but has her foolish thought." The queen demanded an ordeal by
fire: if a hair of her were burned, she would be torn by horses. She
confessed that the horn was in so far right that she had once given
a ring to a youth who had killed a giant that had accused Gawain of
treason, etc. She thought this youth would be a desirable addition to
the court. Arthur was not convinced: he would make everybody try the
horn now, king, duke, and count, for he would not be the only one to
be shamed. Eleven kings, thirty counts, all who essay, spill: they are
very angry, and bid the devil take him who brought and him who sent the
horn. When Arthur saw this, he began to laugh: he regarded the horn as
a great present, he said, and he would part with it to nobody except
the man that could drink out of it. The queen blushed so prettily that
he kissed her three times, and asked her pardon for his bad humor.
The queen said, Let everybody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-263" id="Pg_1-263">[Pg 263]</a></span> take the horn, small and great. There
was a knight who was the happiest man in all the court, the least a
braggart, the most mannerly, and the most redoubtable after Gawain. His
name was Garadue, and he had a wife, <i>mout leal</i>, who was a fairy for
beauty, and surpassed by none but the queen. Garadue looked at her.
She did not change color. "Drink," she said; "indeed, you are at fault
to hesitate." She would never have husband but him: for a woman should
be a dove, and accept no second mate. Garadue was naturally very much
pleased: he sprang to his feet, took the horn, and, crying Wassail! to
the king, drank out every drop. Arthur presented him with Cirencester,
and, for his wife's sake, with the horn, which was exhibited there on
great days.</p>

<p>The romance of Perceval le Gallois, by Chrestien de Troyes and others
(second half of the twelfth century), describes Arthur, like the
fabliau, as putting off dinner till he should hear of some strange
news or adventure. A knight rides into the hall, with an ivory horn,
gold-banded and richly jewelled, hanging from his neck, and presents it
to the king. Have it filled with pure water, says the bearer, and the
water will turn to the best wine in the world, enough for all who are
present. "A rich present!" exclaims Kay. But no knight whose wife or
love has betrayed him shall drink without spilling. "Or empire vostre
présens," says Kay. The king has the horn filled, and does not heed
Guenever, who begs him not to drink, for it is some enchantment, to
shame honest folk. "Then I pray God," says the queen, "that if you try
to drink you may be wet." The king essays to drink, and Guenever has
her prayer. Kay has the same luck, and all the knights,<a name="FNanchor_1_228" id="FNanchor_1_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> till the
horn comes to Carados (Brisié-Bras). Carados, as in the lai, hesitates;
his wife (Guinon, Guimer) looks at him, and says, Drink! He spills not
a drop. Guenever and many a dame hate nothing so much as her. Perceval
le Gallois, ed. Potvin, II, 216 ff, vv 15,640-767.<a name="FNanchor_1_229" id="FNanchor_1_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<p>The story of 'Le Livre de Carados,' in Perceval, is given in abridgment
by the author of Le Roman du Renard contrefait, writing in the second
half of the fourteenth century: Tarbé, Poètes de Champagne antérieurs
au siècle de François I<sup>er</sup>, Histoire de Quarados Brun-Bras, p. 79 ff.
The horn here becomes a cup.</p>

<p>A meistergesang, entitled 'Dis ist Frauw Tristerat Horn von Saphoien,'
and found in the same fifteenth-century manuscript as Der Lanethen
Mantel, Bruns, as before, p. 139, preserves many features of the lai.
While Arthur is at table with seven other kings and their wives, a
damsel comes, bringing an ivory horn, with gold letters about the rim,
a present from Frau Tristerat of Savoy. The king sends for a clerk to
read the inscription, and declares he will begin the experiment. The
damsel prudently retires. Arthur is thoroughly wet, and on the point of
striking the queen, but is prevented by a knight. The seven kings then
take the horn, one after the other. Six of them fare like Arthur. The
king of Spain looks at his wife, fearing shame. She encourages him to
drink, saying, as in the other meistergesang, If we are poor in goods,
we are rich in honor. Arthur presents him with the horn, and adds
cities and lands. Another copy of this piece was printed by Zingerle,
in Germania, V, 101, 'Das goldene Horn.' The queen is aus der Syrenen
lant.<a name="FNanchor_1_230" id="FNanchor_1_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

<p>A fastnachtspiel gives substantially the same form to the story:
Keller, Nachlese, No 127, p. 183. Arthur invites seven kings and
queens to his court. His wife wishes him to ask his sister, the Queen
of Cyprus, also; but she has offended him, and he cannot be prevailed
upon to do it. The Queen of Cyprus sends the horn to Arthur by her
maid as a gift<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-264" id="Pg_1-264">[Pg 264]</a></span> from a queen who is to be nameless, and in fulfilling
her charge the messenger describes her lady simply as a sea princess.
The inscription is read aloud by one of Arthur's knights. The King of
Spain carries off the honors, and receives in gift, besides the horn, a
ducal crown, and gold to boot. Arthur resolves that the horn shall be
forgotten, and no grudge borne against the women, and proposes a dance,
which he leads off with his wife.<a name="FNanchor_1_231" id="FNanchor_1_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p>

<p>We have Arthur joining in a dance under nearly the same circumstances
in an English "bowrd" found in a MS. of about the middle of the
fifteenth century (Ashmolean Museum, No 61). The king has a bugle
horn, which always stands before him, and often amuses himself by
experimenting with it. Those who cannot drink without spilling are set
at a table by themselves, with willow garlands on their heads, and
served with the best. Upon the occasion of a visit from the Duke of
Gloucester, the king, wishing to entertain his guest with an exhibition
of the property of the horn, says he will try all who are present. He
begins himself, as he was wont to do, but this time spills. He takes
the mishap merrily, and says he may now join in a dance which the

<p>Heinrich von dem Türlîn narrates the episode of the probation by the
Horn with many variations of his own, among them the important one of
subjecting the women to the test as well as the men.<a name="FNanchor_1_233" id="FNanchor_1_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> In his Crône,
put at 1200-10, a misshapen, dwarfish knight, whose skin is overgrown
with scales, riding on a monster who is fish before and dolphin behind,
with wings on its legs, presents himself to Arthur on Christmas Day
as an envoy from a sea king, who offers the British monarch a gift on
condition of his first granting a boon. The gift is a cup, made by a
necromancer of Toledo, of which no man or woman can drink who has been
false to love, and it is to be the king's if there shall be anybody
at the court who can stand the test. The ladies are sent for, and the
messenger gives the cup first to them. They all spill. The knights
follow, Arthur first; and he, to the general astonishment, bears
the proof, which no one else does except the sea king's messenger.

466-3189.</p>

<p>The prose Tristan confines the proof to the women, and transfers the
scene to King Mark's court. Morgan the Fay having sent the enchanted
horn to Arthur's court by the hands of a damsel, to avenge herself
on Guenever, two knights who had a spite against Mark and Tristan
intercept it, and cause the horn to be taken to King Mark, who is
informed that no lady that has been false to her lord can drink of it
without spilling. Yseult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-265" id="Pg_1-265">[Pg 265]</a></span> spills, and the king says she deserves to
die. But, fortunately or unfortunately, all the rest of the ladies save
four are found to be in the same plight as the queen. The courtiers,
resolved to make the best of a bad matter, declare that they have no
confidence in the probation, and the king consents to treat the horn as
a deception, and acquits his wife.<a name="FNanchor_1_235" id="FNanchor_1_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>

<p>Ariosto has introduced the magical vessel made by Morgan the Fay for

<p>In a piece in the Wunderhorn, I, 389, ed. 1819, called 'Die
Ausgleichung,' and purporting to be from oral tradition, but reading
like an imitation, or at most a reconstruction, of a meistergesang,
the cup and mantle are made to operate conjointly: the former to
convict a king and his knights, the other a queen and her ladies, of
unfaithfulness in love. Only the youngest of the ladies can wear the
mantle, and only the oldest of the knights, to whom she is espoused,
can drink from the cup. This knight, on being presented with the cup,
turns into a dwarf; the lady, on receiving the gift of the mantle, into
a fay. They pour a drop of wine from the cup upon the mantle, and give
the mantle to the queen, and the cup, empty, to the king. After this,
the king and all the world can drink without inconvenience, and the
mantle fits every woman. But the stain on the mantle grows bigger every
year, and the cup gives out a hollow sound like tin! An allegory, we
may suppose, and, so far as it is intelligible, of the weakest sort.</p>

<p>Tegau Eurvron is spoken of in Welsh triads as one of the three chaste
ladies, and again as one of the three fair ladies, of Arthur's
court.<a name="FNanchor_1_237" id="FNanchor_1_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> She is called the wife of Caradawe Vreichvras by various
Welsh writers, and by her surname of "Gold-breasted" she should be
so.<a name="FNanchor_1_238" id="FNanchor_1_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> If we may trust the author of The Welsh Bards, Tegau was the
possessor of three treasures or rarities "which befitted none but
herself," a mantle, a goblet, and a knife. The mantle is mentioned in a
triad,<a name="FNanchor_1_239" id="FNanchor_1_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> and is referred to as having the variable hue attributed to
it in our ballad and elsewhere. There are three things, says the triad,
of which no man knows the color; the peacock's expanded tail, the
mantle of Tegau Eurvron, and the miser's pence. Of this mantle, Jones,
in whose list of "Thirteen Rarities of Kingly Regalia" of the Island
of Britain it stands eleventh, says, No one could put it on who had
dishonored marriage, nor a young damsel who had committed incontinence;
but it would cover a chaste<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-266" id="Pg_1-266">[Pg 266]</a></span> woman from top to toe: Welsh Bards, II,
49. The mantle certainly seems to be identified by what is said of its
color in the (not very ancient) triad, and so must have the property
attributed to it by Jones, but one would be glad to have had Jones cite
chapter and verse for his description.</p>

<p>There is a drinking-horn among the Thirteen Precious Things of the
Island of Britain, which, like the conjurer's bottle of our day,
will furnish any liquor that is called for, and a knife which will
serve four-and-twenty men at meat "all at once." How this horn and
this knife should befit none but the chaste and lovely Tegau, it is
not easy to comprehend. Meanwhile the horn and the knife are not the
property of Cradock's wife, in the English ballad: the horn falls to
Cradock of right, and the knife was his from the beginning. Instead of
Tegau's mantle we have in another account a mantle of Arthur, which is
the familiar cloak that allows the wearer to see everything without
himself being seen. Not much light, therefore, but rather considerable
mist, comes from these Welsh traditions, of very uncertain date and
significance. It may be that somebody who had heard of the three Welsh
rarities, and of the mantle and horn as being two of them, supposed
that the knife must have similar virtues with the horn and mantle,
whence its appearance in our ballad; but no proof has yet been given
that the Welsh horn and knife had ever a power of testing chastity.<a name="FNanchor_1_240" id="FNanchor_1_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p>

<p>Heinrich von dem Türlin, not satisfied with testing Arthur's court
first with the mantle, and again with the horn, renews the experiment
with a Glove, in a couple of thousand lines more of tedious imitation
of 'Cort Mantel,'<a name="FNanchor_1_241" id="FNanchor_1_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> Crône, 22,990-24,719. This glove renders the
right side of the body invisible, when put on by man or woman free of
blame, but leaves in the other case some portion of that side visible
and bare. A great many ladies and knights don the glove, and all have
reason to regret the trial except Arthur and Gawain.<a name="FNanchor_1_242" id="FNanchor_1_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

<p>There is another German imitation of the fabliau of the mantle, in the
form (1) of a farce of the fifteenth century and (2) of a meistergesang
printed in the sixteenth. In these there is substituted for the mantle
a Crown that exposes the infidelity of husbands.</p>

<p>1. "Das Vasnachtspil mit der Kron."<a name="FNanchor_1_243" id="FNanchor_1_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> A "master" has been sent to
Arthur's court with a rich crown, which the King of Abian wishes to
present to whichever king or lord it shall fit, and it will fit only
those who have not "lost their honor." The King of Orient begins the
trial, very much against his will: the crown turns to ram's horns.
The King of Cyprus is obliged to follow, though he says the devil is
in the crown: the crown hangs about his neck. Appeals are made to
Arthur that the trial may now stop, so that the knights may devote
themselves to the object for which they had come together, the service
and honor of the ladies. But here Lanet, Arthur's sister (so she is
styled), interposes, and expresses a hope that no honors are intended
the queen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-267" id="Pg_1-267">[Pg 267]</a></span> for she is not worthy of them, having broken her faith.
Arthur is very angry, and says that Lanet has by her injurious language
forfeited all her lands, and shall be expelled from court. (Cf. Der
Lanethen Mantel, p. 261.) A knight begs the king to desist, for he who
heeds every tale that is told of his wife shall never be easy.</p>

<p>2. The meistergesang 'Die Krone der Königin von Afion.'<a name="FNanchor_1_244" id="FNanchor_1_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> While his
majesty of Afion is holding a great feast, a youth enters the hall
bearing a splendid crown, which has such chaste things in it that no
king can wear it who haunts false love. The crown had been secretly
made by order of the queen. The king wishes to buy the crown at any
price, but the youth informs him that it is to be given free to the
man who can wear it. The king asks the favor of being the first to try
the crown: when put on his head it falls down to his back. The King of
Portugal is eager to be next: the crown falls upon his shoulder. The
King of Holland at first refuses to put on the crown, for there was
magic in it, and it was only meant to shame them: but he is obliged
to yield, and the crown goes to his girdle. The King of Cyprus offers
himself to the adventure: the crown falls to his loins. And so with
eleven. But there was a "Young Philips," King of England, who thought
he might carry off the prize. His wife was gray and old and ugly, and
quite willing, on this account, to overlook e bisserle Falschheit, and
told him that he might spare himself. But he would not be prevented;
so they put the crown on him, and it fitted to a hair. This makes an
edifying pendant to 'Der Luneten Mantel,' p. 261.</p>

<p>Still another imitation is the Magical Bridge in the younger Titurel
which Klingsor throws over the Sibra. Knights and ladies assembled at
Arthur's court, if less than perfect<a name="FNanchor_1_245" id="FNanchor_1_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a>, on attempting to ride over
it are thrown off into the water, or stumble and fall on the bridge:
ed. Hahn, p. 232 ff, st. 2337 ff. Hans Sachs has told this story twice,
with Virgil for the magician: ed. Keller, Historia, König Artus mit der
ehbrecher-brugk, II, 262; Goedeke, Dichtungen von Hans Sachs, I, 175.
Kirchhof follows Hans Sachs in a story in Wendunmuth, ed. Österley, II,
38.</p>

<p>Florimel's Girdle, in the fourth book of the 'Fairy Queen,' canto v,
once more, is formed on the same pattern.<a name="FNanchor_1_246" id="FNanchor_1_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>

<p>There might be further included in imitations of the horn or mantle
test several other inventions which are clearly, as to form, modelled
on this original, but which have a different object: the valley from
which no false lover could escape till it had been entered by one "qui
de nulle chose auroit vers s'amie fausé ne mespris, nè d'euvre nè
de pensée nè de talent," the prose Lancelot in Jonckbloet, II, lxix
(Warnatsch), Ferrario, Storia ed Analisi, Lancilotto del Lago, III,
372, Legrand, Fabliaux, I, 156; the arch in Amadis, which no man or
woman can pass who has been unfaithful to a first love, and again, the
sword which only the knight who loves his lady best can draw, and the
partly withered garland which becomes completely fresh on the head of
the lady who best loves her husband or lover, Amadís de Gaula, l. ii,
introduccion, c. 1, c. 14, and ballad 1890 in Duran, II, 665; the cup
of congealed tears in Palmerin of England, which liquefies in the hand
of the best knight and faithfulest lover, chapters 87-89, II, 322 ff,
ed. of London, 1807.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-268" id="Pg_1-268">[Pg 268]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides those which have been spoken of, not a few other criterions of
chastity occur in romantic tales.</p>

<p><b>Bed clothes and bed.</b> 'Gil Brenton,' <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>; the
corresponding Swedish ballad, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>E</b>; Danish,

<p>A chair in which no leal maiden can sit, or will sit till bidden (?).

<p><b>Flowers</b> [foliage]. 1. In the Sanskrit story of Guhasena,
the merchant's son, and Devasmitá, this married pair, who are to
be separated for a time, receive from Shíva each a red lotus: if
either should be unfaithful, the lotus in the hand of the other would
fade, but not otherwise: Kathá Sarit Ságara, ch. 13, Tawney, I, 86,
Brockhaus, I, 137. 2. In the Tales of a Parrot, a soldier, going into
service, receives from his wife a rose [flower, nosegay], which will
keep fresh as long as she remains true: Rosen, Tuti-nameh, from the
Turkish version, I, 109; Wickerhauser, also from the Turkish, p. 57;
Iken, p. 30,<a name="FNanchor_1_248" id="FNanchor_1_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> from the Persian of Kadiri. 3. So the knight Margon
in the French romance of Perceforest, vol. IV, ch. 16 and 17. 4. In
a Turkish tale found in a manuscript collection called 'Joy after
Sorrow,' an architect or housewright, having to leave home for want of
employment, is presented by his wife with a bunch of evergreen of the
same property. 5. An English story of a wright reverts to the rose.
A widow, having nothing else to give with her daughter, presents the
bridegroom with a rose-garland, which will hold its hue while his wife
is "stable:" 'The Wright's Chaste Wife,' by Adam of Cobsam, from a
manuscript of about 1462, ed. Furnivall.<a name="FNanchor_1_249" id="FNanchor_1_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>

<p><b>A shirt</b> [mantle]. 1. In connection with the same incidents
there is substituted for the unfading flower, in Gesta Romanorum, 69,
a shirt. This a knight's wife gives to a carpenter or housewright who
has married her daughter, and it will not need washing, will not tear,
wear, or change color, as long as both husband and wife are faithful,
but will lose all its virtues if either is untrue. The shirt is given
by a wife to a husband in several versions of an otherwise different
story. 2. In the German meistergesang and the Flemish tale Alexander
of Metz: Körner, Historische Volkslieder, p. 49, No 8; Goedeke,
Deutsche Dichtung im Mittelalter, 2d ed., p. 569 ff; 'De Historia van
Florentina,' etc., Van den Bergh, De nederlandsche Volksromaus, p. 52
f. 3. In the story 'Von dem König von Spanien<a name="FNanchor_1_250" id="FNanchor_1_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> und seiner Frau,'
Müllenhoff, Sagen, u. s. w., p. 586, No 607, a wife gives the shirt
to her husband the morning after the wedding: it will always be white
until she dies, when it will turn black, or unless she misbehaves,
in which case it will be spotted. 4. 'Die getreue Frau,' Plönnies,
in Wolf's Zeitschrift für deutsche Mythologie,' II, 377. An English
princess gives her consort, a Spanish prince, at parting, a white
shirt which will not spot as long as she is faithful. 5. 'Die treue
Frau,' Curtze, Volksüberlieferungen aus Waldeck, p. 146. A merchant's
son, married to a princess, goes away for a voyage; they change rings
and shirts, and neither shirt will soil until one of the two shall be
untrue. 6. 'Die getreue Frau,' J. W. Wolf, Deutsche Hausmärchen, at
p. 102. A prince, going on a voyage, gives his sword to his wife; as
long as the blade is not spotted, he is faithful. He receives from the
princess a mantle; as long as it is white, her faith is inviolate.</p>

<p><b>A picture.</b> For the rose, as in Perceforest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-269" id="Pg_1-269">[Pg 269]</a></span> there is
substituted, in a story otherwise essentially the same, a picture.
A knight, compelled to leave his wife, receives from a magician a
picture of her, small enough to carry in a box about his person, which
will turn yellow if she is tempted, pale if she wavers, black if she
yields, but will otherwise preserve its fresh hues: Bandello, Part I,
nov. 21. This tale, translated in Painter's Palace of Pleasure, 1567
(ed. Haslewood, II, 471, nov. 28), furnished the plot for Massinger's
'Picture,' 1630. The miniature will keep its color as long as the woman
is innocent and unattempted, will grow yellow if she is solicited but
unconquered, and black if she surrenders: Act I, Scene 1. Bandello's
story is also the foundation of Sénecé's tale, 'Filer le parfait
amour,' with a wax image taking the place of the picture: &#338;uvres
Choisies, ed. Charles et Cap, p. 95.<a name="FNanchor_1_251" id="FNanchor_1_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a></p>

<p><b>A ring.</b> The picture is exchanged for a ring in a French tale
derived, and in parts almost translated, from Bandello's: the sixth in
'Les Faveurs et les Disgraces de l'Amour,' etc., said to have appeared
in 1696.<a name="FNanchor_1_252" id="FNanchor_1_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> A white stone set in the ring may become yellow or black
under circumstances. Such a ring Rimnild gave Horn Child: when the
stone should grow wan, her thoughts would have changed; should it
grow red, she is no more a maid: see p. 192. A father, being required
to leave three daughters, gives them each such a ring in Basile,
Pentamerone, <span class="smcap">III</span>, 4. The rings are changed into glass distaffs
in 'L'Adroite Princesse,' an imitation of this story by Mlle. Lhéritier
de Villaudon, which has sometimes been printed with Perrault's tales:
Perrault, Contes des Fées, ed. Giraud, p. 239; Dunlop, ch. 13.</p>

<p><b>A mirror</b>, in the History of Prince Zeyn Alasnam, reflecting the
image of a chaste maid, will remain unblurred: Arabian Nights, Scott,
IV, 120, 124; 1001 Nacht, Habicht, VI, 146, 150; etc. Virgil made a
mirror of like property; it exposed the woman that was "new-fangle,"
wandelmüetic, by the ignition of a "worm" in the glass: Meisterlieder
der Kolmarer Handschrift, Bartsch, p. 605 (Warnatsch). There is
also one of these mirrors in Primaleon, l. ii, cap. 27; Rajna, Le
Fonti dell' Orlando Furioso, p. 504, note 3. Alfred de Musset, in
'Barberine,' substitutes a pocket-mirror for the picture in Bandello,
Part I, nov. 21: &#338;uvres Complètes, III, 378 ff.</p>

<p><b>A harp</b>, in the hands of an image, upon the approach of a
<i>despucellée</i>, plays out of tune and breaks a string: Perceval le
Gallois, II, 149, vv 13, 365-72 (Rajna, as above).</p>

<p>A crystal <b>brook</b>, in the amiral's garden in Flor and Blancheflor,
when crossed by a virgin remains pellucid, but in the other case
becomes red, or turbid: ed. Du Méril, p. 75, vv 1811-14; Bekker,
Berlin Academy, XLIV, 26, vv 2069-72; Fleck, ed. Sommer, p. 148, vv
4472-82; Swedish, ed. Klemming, p. 38, 1122-25; Lower Rhine, Haupt's
Zeitschrift, XXI, 321, vv 57-62; Middle Greek, Bekker, Berlin Academy,
1845, p. 165, Wagner, Mediæval Greek Texts, p. 40 f, vv 1339-48; etc.
In the English poem, Hartshorne's Ancient Metrical Tales, p. 93, if a
clean maid wash her hands in the water, it remains quiet and clear; but
if one who has lost her purity do this, the water will yell like mad
and become red as blood.</p>

<p>The <b>stone</b> Aptor, in Wigamur, vv 1100-21, is red to the sight of
clean man or woman, but misty to others: Von der Hagen und Büsching,
Deutsche Gedichte des Mittelalters, p. 12 (Warnatsch).<a name="FNanchor_1_253" id="FNanchor_1_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>

<p>A <b>statue</b>, in an Italian ballad, moved its eyes when young
women who had sacrificed their honor were presented to it: Ferraro,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-270" id="Pg_1-270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
Canti popolari di Ferrara, Cento e Pontelagoscuro, p. 84, 'Il Conte
Cagnolino.' There was said to be a statue of Venus in Constantinople
which could not be approached by an incontinent woman without a very
shameful exposure; and again, a pillar surmounted by four horns, which
turned round three times if any [Greek: keratas] came up to it.<a name="FNanchor_1_254" id="FNanchor_1_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>
Virgil, 'Filius,' made a brass statue which no misbehaving woman might
touch, and a vicious one received violent blows from it: Meisterlieder
der Kolmarer Handschrift, Bartsch, p. 604, 14th century. This statue
would bite off the fingers of an adulteress if they were put in its
mouth, according to a poem of the same century published by Bartsch
in Germania, IV, 237; and a third version makes the statue do this to
<i>all</i> perjurers, agreeing in other respects with the second: Kolmarer
Meisterlieder, as before, p. 338. In the two last the offence of the
wife causes a horn to grow out of the husband's forehead. Much of
the story in these poems is derived from the fifteenth tale of the
Shukasaptati, where a woman offers to pass between the legs of a statue
of a Yaksha, which only an innocent one can do: Benfey, Pantschatantra,
I, 457.<a name="FNanchor_1_255" id="FNanchor_1_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></p>

<p>According to a popular belief in Austria, says J. Grimm, you may know
a clean maid by her being able to blow out a candle with one puff and
to light it again with another. The phrase was known in Spain: "Matar
un candil con un soplo y encenderlo con otro." Grimm adds that it is
an article of popular faith in India that a virgin can make a ball of
water, or carry water in a sieve: Rechtsalterthümer, p. 932.<a name="FNanchor_1_256" id="FNanchor_1_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></p>

<p>An ordeal for chastity is a feature in several of the Greek romances.
In Heliodorus's Æthiopica, <span class="smcap">X</span>, 8, 9, victims to be offered
to the sun and moon, who must be pure, are obliged to mount a
<b>brazier</b> covered with a golden grating. The soles of those who
are less than perfect are burned. Theagenes and Chariclea experience
no inconvenience. The Clitophon and Leucippe of Achilles Tatius,
<span class="smcap">VIII</span>, 6, 13, 14, has a <b>cave</b> in the grove of Diana of
Ephesus, in which they shut up a woman. If it is a virgin, a delicious
melody is presently heard from a syrinx, the doors open of themselves,
and the woman comes out crowned with pine leaves; if not a virgin,
a wail is heard, and the woman is never seen again. There is also a
not perfectly convincing trial, by the Stygian <b>water</b>, in § 12,
which seems to be imitated in the Hysmine and Hysminias of Eustathius
[Eumathius], <span class="smcap">VIII</span>, 7, <span class="smcap">XI</span>, 17. In the temple of Diana,
at Artycomis, stands a statue of the goddess, with bow in hand, and
from about her feet flows water like a roaring river. A woman, crowned
with laurel, being put in, she will float quietly, if all is right; but
should she not have kept her allegiance to Dian, the goddess bends her
bow as if to shoot at her head, which causes the culprit to duck, and
the water carries off her wreath.<a name="FNanchor_1_257" id="FNanchor_1_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-271" id="Pg_1-271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>

<p>It is prescribed in Numbers v, 11-31, that any man jealous of his
wife may bring her to the priest, who shall, with and after various
ceremonies, give her a bitter drink of holy water in which dust from
the floor of the tabernacle has been infused. If she have trespassed,
her body shall swell and rot. In the Pseudo-Matthew's Gospel, ch.
xii, Joseph and Mary successively take this aquam potationis domini.
No pretender to innocence could taste this and then make seven turns
round the altar, without some sign of sin appearing in the face.
The experiment shows both to be faultless. So, with some variation,
the sixteenth chapter of the Protevangelium of James. This trial is
the subject of one of the Coventry Mysteries, No 14, p. 137 ff, ed.
Halliwell, and no doubt of other scripture plays. It is naturally
introduced into Wernher's Maria, Hoffmann, Fundgruben, II, 188, line 26
ff, and probably into other lives of the Virgin.</p>

<p>Herodotus relates, <span class="smcap">II</span>, 111, that Pheron, son of Sesostris,
after a blindness of ten years' duration, received an intimation from
an oracle that he would recover his sight upon following a certain
prescription, such as we are assured is still thought well of in Egypt
in cases of ophthalmia. For this the coöperation of a chaste woman was
indispensable. Repeatedly balked, the king finally regained his vision,
and collecting in a town many women of whom he had vainly hoped aid,
in which number his queen was included, he set fire to the place and
burned both it and them, and then married the woman to whom he was so
much indebted. (First cited in the Gentleman's Magazine, 1795, vol. 65,
I, 114.) The coincidence with foregoing tales is certainly curious, but
to all appearance accidental.<a name="FNanchor_1_258" id="FNanchor_1_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></p>

<p>The 'Boy and the Mantle' was printed "verbatim" from his manuscript
by Percy in the Reliques, III, 3, ed. 1765. The copy at p. 314 is of
course the same "revised and altered" by Percy, but has been sometimes
mistaken for an independent one.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_211" id="Footnote_1_211"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_211"><span class="label">[211]</span></a> After I had finished what I had to say in the way
of introduction to this ballad, there appeared the study of the
Trinkhorn and Mantelsage, by Otto Warnatsch: Der Mantel, Bruchstück
eines Lanzeletromans, etc., Breslau, 1883. To this very thorough
piece of work, in which the relations of the multiform versions of
the double-branched story are investigated with a care that had never
before been attempted, I naturally have frequent occasion to refer, and
by its help I have supplied some of my deficiencies, indicating always
the place by the author's name.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_212" id="Footnote_1_212"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_212"><span class="label">[212]</span></a> The Bibliothèque des Romans, 1777, Février, pp. 112-115,
gives an abstract of a small printed piece in prose, there assigned to
the beginning of the sixteenth century, which, as Warnatsch observes,
p. 72, must have been a different thing from the tale given by Legrand,
inasmuch as it brings in Lancelot and Gawain as suppressing the jests
of Kay and Dinadam.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_213" id="Footnote_1_213"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_213"><span class="label">[213]</span></a> The custom of Arthur not to eat till he had heard of
some adventure or strange news was confined to those days when he held
full court, according to Perceval le Gallois, II, 217, 15,664-71, and
the Roman de Perceval, fol. lxxviii. It is mentioned, with the same
limitations, I suppose, in the Roman de Lancelot, III, fol. lxxxii,
and we learn from this last romance, I, fol. xxxvi, that Arthur was
accustomed to hold a court and wear his crown five times in the year,
at Easter, Ascension-day, Pentecost, All Saints, and Christmas. The
Roman de Merlin, II, lvi<sup>b</sup>, or, as cited by Southey, II, 48, 49, says
that "King Arthur, after his first dinner at Logres, when he brought
home his bride, made a vow that while he wore a crown he never would
seat himself at table till some adventure had occurred." In Malory's
King Arthur, Kay reminds the king that this had been the old custom
of his court at Pentecost. Arthur is said to observe this custom on
Christmas, "vpon such a dere day," in Sir Gawayn and the Green Knight,
Madden, p. 6, vv 90-99. Messire Gauvain says "à feste ne mangast,
devant," etc., p. 2, vv 18-21. Wolfram von Eschenbach's Parzival does
not limit the custom to high holidays, ed. Bartsch, I, 331, vv 875-79;
and see Riddarasögur, Parcevals Saga, etc., ed. Kölbing, p. 26. Neither
does Wigalois, vv 247-51, or a fragment of Daniel von Blühenthal,
Symbolæ ad literaturam Teutonicam, p. 465, cited by Benecke, Wigalois,
p. 436 f, or the Färöe Galians kvæði, Kölbing, in Germania, XX, 397.
See Madden's Syr Gawayne, which has furnished much of this note, pp
310-12; Southey's King Arthur, II, 203, 462. Robin Hood imitates
Arthur: see the beginning of the Little Gest.</p></div>

supply the earlier history. Samson's father is another Arthur, king of
England. An abstract of so much of the saga as pertains to the Mantle
is given by Cederschiöld and Wulff, p. 90f. Warnatsch, p. 73 f, shows
that the Rímur and Samson had probably a common source, independent of
the Möttulssaga.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_217" id="Footnote_1_217"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_217"><span class="label">[217]</span></a> By Warnatsch, who gives the text with the corresponding
passages of the fabliau in a parallel column, pp 8-54: the argument
for Heinrich's authorship, pp 85-105. 'Der Mantel' had been previously
printed in Haupt and Hoffmann's Altdeutsche Blätter, II, 217, and by
Müllenhoff in his Altdeutsche Sprachproben, p. 125. Of this poem,
which Warnatsch, pp 105-110, holds to be a fragment of a lost romance
of Lanzelet, written before the 'Crône,' only 994 verses are left.
Deducting about a hundred of introduction, there are some 782 German
against some 314 French verses, an excess which is owing, no doubt,
largely to insertions and expansions on the part of Heinrich, but in
some measure to the existing texts of the fabliau having suffered
abridgment. The whole matter of the church service, with the going and
coming, is dispatched in less than a dozen verses in the French, but
occupies more than seventy in German, and just here we read in the
French:
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ci ne vueil je plus demorer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ni de noient fere lone conte,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Si con l'estoire le raconte.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>
But possibly the last verse should be taken with what follows.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_218" id="Footnote_1_218"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_218"><span class="label">[218]</span></a> In Hahn, Griechische Märchen, No 70, II, 60 f, a walnut
contains a dress with the earth and its flowers displayed on it, an
almond one with the heaven and its stars, a hazel-nut one with the
sea and its fishes. No 7, I, 99, a walnut contains a complete costume
exhibiting heaven with its stars, a hazel-nut another with the sea
and its waves. No 67, II, 33, an almond encloses a woman's dress with
heaven and its stars on it, a hazel-nut a suit for her husband. In the
Grimms' No 113, three walnuts contain successively each a finer dress
than the other, II, 142 f, ed. 1857. There are three similar nuts in
Haltrich, No 43, and in Volksmärchen aus Venetien, Jahrbuch für r. u.
e. Lit., VII, 249, No 12. Ulrich's mantle is worked with all manner of
beasts, birds, and sea monsters, on earth or under, and betwixt earth
and heaven: Lanzelet, 5820-27.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_219" id="Footnote_1_219"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_219"><span class="label">[219]</span></a> I cite the text according to Warnatsch. Warnatsch thinks
it worth noticing that it is the queen only, in Mantel 771 f, as in our
ballad, st. 14, that curses the maker of the mantle; not, as in the
fabliau, the gentlemen whose feelings were so much tried. These, like
the queen in the ballad, ont maudit le mantel, et celui qui li aporta.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_220" id="Footnote_1_220"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_220"><span class="label">[220]</span></a> Not even for Ginovere hübsch unde guot, or Enîte diu
reine. The queen has always been heedful of her acts, and has never
done anything wrong: doch ist siu an den gedenken missevarn, Heaven
knows how. Ulrich is very feeble here.
</p>
<p>
A remark is here in place which will be still more applicable to
some of the tests that are to be spoken of further on. Both the
French fabliau and the English ballad give to the mantle the power of
detecting the woman that has once done amiss, a de rien messerré. We
naturally suppose that we understand what is meant. The trial in the
fabliau is so conducted as to confirm our original conception of the
nature of the inquest, and so it is, in the case of Arthur's queen,
Kay's lady, and the old knight's wife, in the ballad. But when we come
to the charmingly pretty passage about Cradock's wife, what are we to
think? Is the mantle in a teasing mood, or is it exhibiting its real
quality? If once to have kissed Cradock's mouth before marriage is
once to have done amiss, Heaven keep our Mirandas and our Perditas,
and Heaven forgive our Juliets and our Rosalinds! ("Les dames et
demoiselles, pour être baisées devant leur noces, il n'est pas la
coutume de France," we know, but this nice custom could hardly have
had sway in England. Is then this passage rendered from something in
French that is lost?) But the mantle, in the ballad, after indulging
its humor or its captiousness for a moment, does Cradock's wife full
justice. The mantle, if uncompromising as to acts, at least does not
assume to bring thoughts under its jurisdiction. Many of the probations
allow themselves this range, and as no definite idea is given of what
is charged, no one need be shocked, or perhaps disturbed, by the number
of convictions. The satire loses zest, and the moral effect is not
improved.</p></div>

English translation. We are further told, in Scalachronica, that this
mantle was afterwards made into a chasuble, and that it is "to this

that Carados and his <i>amie</i> deposited the mantle in a Welsh abbey.
The Skikkju Rímur say that the lady presented it to the cloister of
Cologne; the Möttulssaga has simply a monastery (and, indeed, the
mantle, as described by some, must have had a vocation that way from
the beginning). "Item, in the castel of Douer ye may see Gauwayn's

into the fabliau, in regular court style, ganz nach höfischer Weise,
about the middle of the 13th century; then goes on to say that even if
the author of the fabliau followed another version of the story, he
must have known the jongleur's poem, because he has repeated some of
the introductory lines of the lai. This excellent scholar happened,
for once, not to observe that the first fourteen lines of the lai,
excepting the fourth, which is questionable, are in a longer metre than
the rest of the poem, in eights and sevens, not sixes, and the first
three of the lai, which agree with the first three of the fabliau, in
the eight-syllable verse of the latter; so that it was not the author
of the fabliau that borrowed. Warnatsch (who has also made this last
remark) has noted other agreements between lai and fabliau, p. 61. Both
of these acknowledge their derivation from an earlier <i>dit, estoire</i>,
not having which we shall find it hard to determine by which and from
what the borrowing was done.</p></div>

the French lai, 94, 97, 99-102, and Wigamur 2623-30 convinces Warnatsch
that the source of this meisterlied must have been a Middle High German
rendering of some form of the Drinking-horn Test closely resembling the
lai. See Warnatsch, p. 66.</p></div>

the kings, p. 206, line 32, p. 214, line 22, is addressed by Arthur as
his nephew, p. 207, line 11, and p. 193, line 30. Carados is called
Arthur's nephew in Perceval (he is son of Arthur's niece), e.g. 15,782,
and Carados, his father, is Carados de <i>Vaigne</i>, II, 117. It is said of
Kalegras's <i>amie</i> in the 'Mantle Rhymes,' <span class="smcap">III</span>, 59, that many a
lady looked down upon her. This may be a chance expression, or possibly
point to the poverty which is attributed to the royal pair of Spain
in Fastnachtspiele, Nos 81, 127, and in Frau Tristerat Horn. In Der
Lanethen Mantel, Laneth is Arthur's niece, and poor: see p. 261.
</p>
<p>
The fastnachtspiel has points in common with the fabliau, and the
assumption of a source which combined features of both lai and fabliau
is warrantable: Warnatsch, pp 66-68.</p></div>

characteristic agreements with Perceval being entirely wanting. There
are agreements with the lai, many more with the fabliau; and Heinrich's
poem, so far as it is not of his own invention, he believes to be
compounded from his own version of the fabliau and some lost version of
the Horn-test: pp 111-114.</p></div>

Caraduz (Crône, 2309, elsewhere) Karadas; Carigras, Kaligras (Rímur);
Karodeus, Caraduel (Perceval, 12,466, 12,457, 12,491, but generally),
Carados, -ot, or; Caraduel (Messire Gauvain, 3943); Garadue (Lai du
Corn); Karadin (Möttuls Saga). Garadue probably == Caraduel, which, in
Percival twice, and once in Messire Gauvain, is used for Carados,
through confusion with Arthur's residence, Carduel, Cardoil. So Karadas
is twice put in the Crône, 16,726, 16,743, for Karidol == Cardoil. Might
not Karadin have been written for Karadiu?</p></div>

Justinian, which, among other clever performances, ostendebat in utero

KING ARTHUR AND KING CORNWALL</h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Percy MS., p. 24. Hales &amp; Furnivall, I, 61; Madden's Syr
Gawayne, p. 275.</p></div>


<p>The mutilation of the earlier pages of the Percy manuscript leaves us
in possession of only one half of this ballad, and that half in eight
fragments, so that even the outline of the story cannot be fully made
out.<a name="FNanchor_1_259" id="FNanchor_1_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> We have, to be sure, the whole of a French poem which must
be regarded as the probable source of the ballad, and, in view of the
recklessness of the destroyer Time, may take comfort; for there are few
things in this kind that the Middle Ages have bequeathed which we could
not better spare. But the losses from the English ballad are still very
regrettable, since from what is in our hands we can see that the story
was treated in an original way, and so much so that comparison does not
stead us materially.</p>

<p>'King Arthur and King Cornwall' is apparently an imitation, or a
traditional variation, of Charlemagne's Journey to Jerusalem and
Constantinople, a <i>chanson de geste</i> of complete individuality and
of remarkable interest. This all but incomparable relic exists in
only a single manuscript,<a name="FNanchor_1_260" id="FNanchor_1_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> and that ill written and not older
than the end of the thirteenth century, while the poem itself may be
assigned to the beginning of the twelfth, if not to the latter part of
the eleventh.<a name="FNanchor_1_261" id="FNanchor_1_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> Subsequently, the story, with modifications, was
introduced into the romance of Galien, and in this setting it occurs
in three forms, two manuscript of the fifteenth century, and the third
a printed edition of the date 1500. These are all in prose, but betray
by metrical remains imbedded in them their descent from a romance in
verse, which there are reasons for putting at least as early as the
beginning of the fourteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_1_262" id="FNanchor_1_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>

<p>A very little of the story, and this little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-275" id="Pg_1-275">[Pg 275]</a></span> much changed, is found in
Italian romances of Charles's Journey to Spain and of Ogier the Dane.
The derivation from Galien is patent.<a name="FNanchor_1_263" id="FNanchor_1_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></p>

<p>The Journey of Charlemagne achieved great popularity, as it needs
must. It forms a section of the Karlamagnus Saga, a prose translation
into Norse of <i>gestes</i> of Charles and his peers, made in the
thirteenth century, and probably for King Hákon the Old, though this
is not expressly said, as in the case of the 'Mantle.' Through the
Norwegian version the story of Charles's journey passed into the other
Scandinavian dialects. There is a Swedish version, slightly defective,
existing in a manuscript earlier than 1450, and known to be older than
the manuscript, and a Danish abridgment, thought to have been made from
the Swedish version, is preserved in a manuscript dated 1480, which
again is probably derived from an elder. Like the 'Mantle,' the Journey
of Charlemagne is treated in Icelandic Rímur, the oldest manuscript
being put at about 1500. These Rhymes (Geiplur, Gabs, Japes), though
their basis is the Norwegian saga, present variations from the existing
manuscripts of this saga. There is also a Färöe traditional ballad upon
this theme, 'Geipa-táttur.' This ballad has much that is peculiar to
itself.<a name="FNanchor_1_264" id="FNanchor_1_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p>

<p>Charlemagne's Journey was also turned into Welsh in the thirteenth
century. Three versions are known, of which the best is in the Red Book
of Hergest.<a name="FNanchor_1_265" id="FNanchor_1_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a></p>

<p>Let us now see what is narrated in the French poem.</p>

<p>One day when Charlemagne was at St Denis he had put on his crown and
sword, and his wife had on a most beautiful crown, too. Charles took
her by the hand, under an olive-tree, and asked her if she had ever
seen a king to whom crown and sword were so becoming. The empress was
so unwise as to reply that possibly he thought too well of himself: she
knew of a king who appeared to even better advantage when he wore his
crown. Charles angrily demanded where this king was to be found: they
would wear their crowns together, and if the French sided with her,
well; but if she had not spoken truth, he would cut off her head. The
empress endeavored to explain away what she had said: the other king
was simply richer, but not so good a knight, etc. Charles bade her name
him, on her head. There being no escape, the empress said she had heard
much of Hugo, the emperor of Greece and Constantinople. "By my faith,"
said Charles, "you have made me angry and lost my love, and are in a
fair way to lose your head, too. I will never rest till I have seen
this king."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-276" id="Pg_1-276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>

<p>The emperor, having made his offering at St Denis, returned to Paris,
taking with him his twelve peers and some thousand of knights. To these
he announced that they were to accompany him to Jerusalem, to adore the
cross and the sepulchre, and that he would incidentally look up a king
that he had heard of. They were to take with them seven hundred camels,
laden with gold and silver, and be prepared for an absence of seven
years.</p>

<p>Charlemagne gave his people a handsome equipment, but not of arms. They
left behind them their lances and swords, and took the pilgrim's staff
and scrip. When they came to a great plain it appeared that the number
was not less than eighty thousand: but we do not have to drag this host
through the story, which concerns itself only with Charles and his
peers. They arrived at Jerusalem one fine day, selected their inns, and
went to the minster. Here Jesus and his apostles had sung mass, and the
chairs which they had occupied were still there. Charles seated himself
in the middle one, his peers on either side. A Jew came in, and, seeing
Charles, fell to trembling; so fierce was the countenance of the
emperor that he dared not look at it, but fled from the church to the
patriarch, and begged to be baptized, for God himself and the twelve
apostles were come. The patriarch went to the church, in procession,
with his clergy. Charles rose and made a profound salutation, the
priest and the monarch embraced, and the patriarch inquired who it
was that had assumed to enter that church as he had done. "Charles is
my name," was the answer. "Twelve kings have I conquered, and I am
seeking a thirteenth whom I have heard of. I have come to Jerusalem to
adore the cross and the sepulchre." The patriarch proving gracious,
Charles went on to ask for relics to take home with him. "A plentet
en avrez," says the patriarch; "St Simeon's arm, St Lazarus's head,
St Stephen's&mdash;" "Thanks!" "The sudarium, one of the nails, the crown
of thorns, the cup, the dish, the knife, some of St Peter's beard,
some hairs from his head&mdash;" "Thanks!" "Some of Mary's milk, of the
holy shift&mdash;" And all these Charles received.<a name="FNanchor_1_266" id="FNanchor_1_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> He stayed four
months in Jerusalem, and began the church of St Mary. He presented the
patriarch with a hundred mule-loads of gold and silver, and asked "his
leave and pardon" to return to France: but first he would find out the
king whom his wife had praised. They take the way through Jericho to
gather palms. The relics are so strong that every stream they come to
divides before them, every blind man receives sight, the crooked are
made straight, and the dumb speak.<a name="FNanchor_1_267" id="FNanchor_1_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> On reaching Constantinople they
have ample reason to be impressed with the magnificence of the place.
Passing twenty thousand knights, who are playing at chess and tables,
dressed in pall and ermine, with fur cloaks training at their feet, and
three thousand damsels in equally sumptuous attire, who are disporting
with their lovers, they come to the king, who is at that moment taking
his day at the plough, not on foot, goad in hand, but seated most
splendidly in a chair drawn by mules, and holding a gold wand, the
plough all gold, too; none of this elegance, however, impairing the
straightness of his majesty's furrow. The kings exchange greetings.
Charles tells Hugo that he is last from Jerusalem, and should be glad
to see him and his knights. Hugo makes him free to stay a year, if he
likes, unyokes the oxen, and conducts his guests to the palace.</p>

<p>The palace is gorgeous in the extreme, and, omitting other
architectural details, it is circular, and so constructed as to turn
like a wheel when the wind strikes it from the west. Charles thinks his
own wealth not worth a glove in comparison, and remembers how he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-277" id="Pg_1-277">[Pg 277]</a></span> had
threatened his wife. "Lordings," he says, "many a palace have I seen,
but none like this had even Alexander, Constantine, or Cæsar." At that
moment a strong wind arose which set the palace in lively motion; the
emperor was fain to sit down on the floor; the twelve peers were all
upset, and as they lay on their backs, with faces covered, said one
to the other, "This is a bad business: the doors are open, and yet we
can't get out!" But as evening approached the wind subsided; the Franks
recovered their legs, and went to supper. At the table they saw the
queen and the princess, a beautiful blonde, of whom Oliver became at
once enamored. After a most royal repast, the king conducted Charles
and the twelve to a bed-chamber, in which there were thirteen beds. It
is doubtful whether modern luxury can vie with the appointments in any
respect, and certain that we are hopelessly behind in one, for this
room was lighted by a carbuncle. But, again, there was one luxury which
Hugo did not allow them, and this was privacy, even so much privacy as
thirteen can have. He had put a man in a hollow place under a marble
stair, to watch them through a little hole.</p>

<p>The Franks, as it appears later, had drunk heavily at supper, and this
must be their excuse for giving themselves over, when in a foreign
country, to a usage or propensity which they had no doubt indulged in
at home, and which is familiar in northern poetry and saga, that of
making brags (gabs, Anglo-Saxon beót, gilp<a name="FNanchor_1_268" id="FNanchor_1_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>). Charles began: Let
Hugo arm his best man in two hauberks and two helms, and set him on a
charger: then, if he will lend me his sword, I will with a blow cut
through helms, hauberks, and saddle, and if I let it have its course,
the blade shall never be recovered but by digging a spear's depth in
the ground. "Perdy," says the man in hiding, "what a fool King Hugo was
when he gave you lodging!"</p>

<p>Roland followed: Tell Hugo to lend me his horn, and I will go into yon
plain and blow such a blast that not a gate or a door in all the city
shall be left standing, and a good man Hugo will be, if he faces me,
not to have his beard burned from his face and his fur robe carried
away. Again said the man under the stair, "What a fool was King Hugo!"</p>

<p>The emperor next called upon Oliver, whose gab was:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Prenget li reis sa fille qui tant at bloi le peil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">En sa chambre nos metet en un lit en requeit;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Se jo n'ai testimoigne de li anuit cent feiz,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Demain perde la teste, par covent li otrei.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"You will stop before that," said the spy; "great shame have you
spoken."</p>

<p>Archbishop Turpin's brag was next in order: it would have been more in
keeping for Turpin of Hounslow Heath, and we have all seen it performed
in the travelling circus. While three of the king's best horses are
running at full speed on the plain, he will overtake and mount the
foremost, passing the others, and will keep four big apples in constant
motion from one hand to the other; if he lets one fall, put out his
eyes.<a name="FNanchor_1_269" id="FNanchor_1_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> "A good brag this," is the comment of the simple scout
(<i>l'escolte</i>), "and no shame to my lord."</p>

<p>William of Orange will take in one hand a metal ball which thirty men
have never been able to stir, and will hurl it at the palace wall and
bring down more than forty toises of it. "The king is a knave if he
does not make you try," says <i>l'escolte</i>.</p>

<p>The other eight gabs may be passed over,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-278" id="Pg_1-278">[Pg 278]</a></span> save one. Bernard de Brusban
says, "You see that roaring stream? To-morrow I will make it leave its
bed, cover the fields, fill the cellars of the city, drench the people,
and drive King Hugo into his highest tower, from which he shall never
come down without my leave." "The man is mad," says the spy. "What a
fool King Hugo was! As soon as morning dawns they shall all pack."</p>

<p>The spy carries his report to his master without a moment's delay. Hugo
swears that if the brags are not accomplished as made, his guests shall
lose their heads, and orders out a hundred thousand men-at-arms to
enforce his resolution.</p>

<p>When the devout emperor of the west came from mass the next morning
(Hugo was evidently not in a state of mind to go), he advanced to meet
his brother of Constantinople, olive branch in hand; but Hugo called
out from far off, "Charles, why did you make me the butt of your brags
and your scorns?" and repeated that all must be done, or thirteen heads
would fall. Charles replied that they had drunk a good deal of wine
the night before, and that it was the custom for the French when they
had gone to bed to allow themselves in jesting. He desired to speak
with his knights. When they were together, the emperor said that they
had drunk too much, and had uttered what they ought not. He caused the
relics to be brought, and they all fell to praying and beating their
breasts, that they might be saved from Hugo's wrath, when lo, an angel
appeared, who bade them not be afraid; they had committed a great folly
yesterday, and must never brag again, but for this time, "Go, begin,
not one of them shall fail."<a name="FNanchor_1_270" id="FNanchor_1_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a></p>

<p>Charles returned to Hugo master of the situation. He repeated that they
had drunk too much wine the night before, and went on to say that it
was an outrage on Hugo's part to set a spy in the room, and that they
knew a land where such an act would be accounted villainy: "but all
shall be carried out; choose who shall begin." Hugo said, Oliver; and
let him not fall short of his boast, or I will cut off his head, and
the other twelve shall share his fate. The next morning, in pursuance
of an arrangement made between Oliver and the princess, the king was
informed that what had been undertaken had been precisely discharged.
"The first has saved himself," says Hugo; "by magic, I believe; now I
wish to know about the rest." "What next?" says Charlemagne. William of
Orange was called for, threw off his furs, lifted the huge ball with
one hand, hurled it at the wall, and threw down more than forty toises.
"They are enchanters," said the king to his men. "Now I should like to
see if the rest will do as much. If one of them fails, I will hang them
all to-morrow." "Do you want any more of the gabs?" asked Charles. Hugo
called upon Bernard to do what he had threatened. Bernard asked the
prayers of the emperor, ran down to the water, and made the sign of the
cross. All the water left its bed, spread over the fields, came into
the city, filled the cellars, drenched the people, and drove King Hugo
into his highest tower; Charles and the peers being the while ensconced
in an old pine-tree, all praying for God's pity.</p>

<p>Charles in the tree heard Hugo in the tower making his moan: he would
give the emperor all his treasure, would become his man and hold his
kingdom of him. The emperor was moved, and prayed that the flood might
stop, and at once the water began to ebb. Hugo was able to descend from
his tower, and he came to Charles, under an "ympe tree," and repeated
what he had uttered in the moment of extremity. "Do you want the rest
of the gabs?" asked Charles. "Ne de ceste semaine," replied Hugo.
"Then, since you are my man," said the emperor, "we will make a holiday
and wear our crowns together."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-279" id="Pg_1-279">[Pg 279]</a></span> When the French saw the two monarchs
walking together, and Charles overtopping Hugo by fifteen inches, they
said the queen was a fool to compare anybody with him.</p>

<p>After this promenade there was mass, at which Turpin officiated, and
then a grand dinner. Hugo once more proffered all his treasures to
Charles, but Charles would not take a denier. "We must be going," he
said. The French mounted their mules, and went off in high spirits.
Very happy was Charles to have conquered such a king without a battle.
Charles went directly to St Denis, and performed his devotions. The
nail and the crown he deposited on the altar, distributed the other
relics over the kingdom, and for the love of the sepulchre he gave up
his anger against the queen.</p>

<p>The story in the English ballad, so far as it is to be collected from
our eight fragments, is that Arthur, represented as King of Little
Britain, while boasting to Gawain of his round table, is told by
Guenever that she knows of one immeasurably finer; the very trestle
is worth his halls and his gold, and the palace it stands in is worth
all Little Britain besides; but not a word will she say as to where
this table and this goodly building may be. Arthur makes a vow never
to sleep two nights in one place till he sees that round table;
and, taking for companions Gawain, Tristram, Sir Bredbeddle, and an
otherwise unknown Sir Marramiles, sets out on the quest.</p>

<p>The pilgrimage which, to save his dignity, Charles makes a cover for
his visit to the rival king forms no part of Arthur's programme.<a name="FNanchor_1_271" id="FNanchor_1_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a>
The five assume a palmer's weed simply for disguise, and travel east
and west, in many a strange country, only to arrive at Cornwall, so
very little a way from home.</p>

<p>The proud porter of Cornwall's gate, a minion swain, befittingly clad
in a suit of gold, for his master is the richest king in Christendom,
or yet in heathenness, is evidently impressed with Arthur's bearing, as
is quite the rule in such cases:<a name="FNanchor_1_272" id="FNanchor_1_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> he has been porter thirty years
and three, but [has never seen the like]. Cornwall would naturally
ask the pilgrims some questions. From their mentioning some shrine of
Our Lady he infers that they have been in Britain,&mdash;Little Britain we
must suppose to be meant. Cornwall asks if they ever knew King Arthur,
and boasts that he had lived seven years in Little Britain, and had
had a daughter by Arthur's wife, now a lady of radiant beauty, and
Arthur has none such.<a name="FNanchor_1_273" id="FNanchor_1_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> He then sends for his steed, which he can
ride three times as far in a day as Arthur can any of his, and we
may suppose that he also exhibits to his guests a horn and a sword
of remarkable properties, and a Bur-low-Beanie, or Billy-Blin, a
seven-headed, fire-breathing fiend whom he has in his service. Arthur
is then conducted to bed, and the Billy-Blin, shut up, as far as we
can make out, in some sort of barrel, or other vessel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-280" id="Pg_1-280">[Pg 280]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_1_274" id="FNanchor_1_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> is set by
Arthur's bed-side to hear and report the talk of the pilgrims. Now, it
would seem, the knights make each their vow or brag. Arthur's is that
he will be the death of Cornwall King before he sees Little Britain.
Gawain, who represents Oliver, will have Cornwall's daughter home with
him. Here there is an unlucky gap. Tristram should undertake to carry
off the horn, Marramiles the steed, and Sir Bredbeddle the sword. But
first it would be necessary to subdue the loathly fiend. Bredbeddle
goes to work without dallying, bursts open the rub-chadler with his
sword, and fights the fire-breathing monster in a style that is a joy
to see; but sword, knife, and axe all break, and he is left without a
weapon. Yet he had something better to fall back on, and that was a
little book which he had found by the seaside, no doubt in the course
of those long travels which conducted the pilgrims from Little Britain
to Cornwall. It was probably a book of Evangiles; our Lord had written
it with his hands and sealed it with his blood. With this little book,
which in a manner takes the place of the relics in the French tale,
for the safety of the pilgrims and the accomplishment of their vows
are secured through it, Bredbeddle conjures the Burlow-beanie, and
shuts him up till wanted in a "wall of stone," which reminds us of the
place in which Hugo's spy is concealed. He then reports to Arthur, who
has a great desire to see the fiend in all his terrors, and, upon the
king's promising to stand firm, Bredbeddle makes the fiend start out
again, with his seven heads and the fire flying out of his mouth. The
Billy-Blin is now entirely amenable to command: Bredbeddle has only
to "conjure" him to do a thing, and it is done. First he fetches down
the steed. Marramiles, who perhaps had vowed to bring off the horse,
considers that he is the man to ride him, but finds he can do nothing
with him, and has to call on Bredbeddle for help. The Billy-Blin is
required to tell how the steed is to be ridden, and reveals that
three strokes of a gold wand which stands in Cornwall's study-window
will make him spring like spark from brand. And so it comes out that
Cornwall is a magician. Next the horn has to be fetched, but, when
brought, it cannot be sounded. For this a certain powder is required.
This the fiend procures, and Tristram blows a blast which rends the
horn up to the midst.<a name="FNanchor_1_275" id="FNanchor_1_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> Finally the Billy-Blin is conjured to fetch
the sword, and with this sword Arthur goes and strikes off Cornwall's
head. So Arthur keeps his vow, and, so far as we can see, all the rest
are in a condition to keep theirs.</p>

<p>The English ballad retains too little of the French story to enable us
to say what form of it this little was derived from. The poem of Galien
would cover all that is borrowed as well as the Journey of Charlemagne.
It may be regarded as an indication of late origin that in this ballad
Arthur is king of <i>Little</i> Britain, that Bredbeddle and Marramiles are
made the fellows of Gawain and Tristram, Bredbeddle carrying off all
the honors, and that Cornwall has had an intrigue with Arthur's queen.
The name Bredbeddle is found elsewhere only in the late Percy version
of the romance of the Green Knight, Hales and Furnivall, II, 56, which
version alludes to a custom of the Knights of the Bath, an order said
to have been instituted by Henry IV at his coronation, in 1399.</p>

<p>The Färöe ballad, 'Geipa-táttur,' exists in four versions: <b>A</b>,

1848, 103 stanzas.<a name="FNanchor_1_276" id="FNanchor_1_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> It repeats the story of the Norse saga, with
a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-281" id="Pg_1-281">[Pg 281]</a></span> moderate number of traditional accretions and changes. The emperor,
from his throne, asks his champions where is his superior [equal].
They all drop their heads; no one ventures to answer but the queen,
who better had been silent. "The emperor of Constantinople" (Hákin,
<b>D</b>), she says, "is thy superior." "If he is not," answers Karl,
"thou shalt burn on bale." In <b>B</b>, when they have already started
for Constantinople, Turpin persuades them to go rather to Jerusalem:
in the other versions it must be assumed that the holy city was on
the route. As Karl enters the church the bells ring and the candles
light of themselves, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>. There are thirteen seats in
the choir: Karl takes the one that Jesus had occupied, and the peers
those of the apostles. A heathen tells the patriarch<a name="FNanchor_1_277" id="FNanchor_1_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> that the Lord
is come down from heaven, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>. The patriarch proceeds
to the church, with no attendance but his altar-book [singing from
his altar-book]; he asks Karl what he has come for, and Karl replies,
to see the halidoms, <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>. In <b>B</b> the
patriarch presents himself to the emperor at his lodging, and inquires
his purpose; and, learning that he is on his way to Constantinople,
for glory, advises him first to go to the church, where the ways and
means of success are to be found. The patriarch gives Karl some of the
relics: the napkin on which Jesus had wiped his hands, cups from which
he had drunk, etc. Karl, in <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, now announces that he
is on his way to Constantinople; the patriarch begs him not to go, for
he will have much to suffer. At the exterior gate of the palace will
be twelve white bears, ready to go at him; the sight of his sword [of
the holy napkin, <b>B</b>] will cause them to fall stone-dead, or at
least harmless, <b>B</b>. At the gate next within there will be twelve
wolf-dogs<a name="FNanchor_1_278" id="FNanchor_1_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> [and further on twelve toads, <b>B</b>], which must be
disposed of in like wise: etc. The castle stands on a hundred pillars,
<b>A</b>, and is full of ingenious contrivances: the floor goes up to
the sky, and the roof comes down to the ground, <b>B</b>. Karl now sets
out, with the patriarch's blessing and escort. Before they reach the
palace they come upon three hundred knights and ladies dancing, which
also had been foretold, and at the portals of the palace they find and
vanquish the formidable beasts. The palace is to the full as splendid
and as artfully constructed as they had been informed: the floor goes
up and the roof comes down, <b>B</b>; there are monstrous figures
(?), with horns at their mouths, and upon a wind rising the horns all
sound, the building begins to revolve, and the Frenchmen jump up, each
clinging to the other, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>. Karl remembers
what his wife had said, <b>A</b>, <b>D</b>.</p>

<p>Of the reception by the monarch of Constantinople nothing further is
said. We are immediately taken to the bedroom, in which there are
twelve beds, with a thirteenth in the middle, and also a stone arch, or
vault, inside of which is a man with a candle. Karl proposes that they
shall choose feats, make boasts, rouses [<i>skemtar</i>, jests, <b>C</b>].
These would inevitably be more or less deranged and corrupted in the
course of tradition. <b>A</b> and <b>C</b> have lost many. Karl's
boast, dropped in <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, is that he will smite King Hákin,
so that the sword's point shall stick in the ground, <b>D</b>; hit the
emperor on the neck and knock him off his horse, <b>A</b>. Roland,
in all, will blow the emperor's hair off his head with the blast of
his horn. Oliver's remains as in the French poem. William of Orange's
ball is changed to a bolt. The exploit with the horses and apples is
assigned to Bernard in <b>D</b>, the only version which preserves it,
as in the Norse saga; and, as in the saga again, it is Turpin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-282" id="Pg_1-282">[Pg 282]</a></span> and not
Bernard, who brings in the river upon the town, and forces the king to
take refuge in the tower.</p>

<p>Early in the morning the spy reports in writing, and King Hákin,
<b>D</b>, says that Karl and his twelve peers shall burn on the bale,
<b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, if they cannot make good their boasts,
<b>B</b>. Karl's queen appears to him in his sleep, <b>A</b>, and bids
him think of last night's words. It is the queen of Constantinople in
<b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b> who rouses Karl to a sense of his plight;
in <b>B</b> she tells him that the brags have been reported, and that
burning will be the penalty unless they be achieved. Karl then sees
that his wife knew what she was saying, and vows to give her Hildarheim
and a scarlet cloak if he gets home alive. He hastens to church; a dove
descends from heaven and sits on his arm [in <b>B</b> a voice comes
from heaven]; he is assured that the boasts shall all be performed, but
never let such a thing be done again. In <b>A</b> three of the feats
are executed, in <b>D</b> four, in <b>C</b> seven, Oliver's in each
case strictly, and Turpin's, naturally, last. The king in <b>C</b> does
the feat which is proposed by Eimer in the saga. <b>A</b> and <b>C</b>
end abruptly with Turpin's exploit. In <b>D</b> Karl falls on his knees
and prays, and the water retires; Karl rides out of Constantinople,
followed three days on the road by Koronatus, as Hákin is now called,
stanza 103: it is Karlamagnús that wears his crown higher. <b>B</b>
takes a turn of its own. Roland, Olger and Oliver are called upon to
do their brags. Roland blows so that nobody in Constantinople can keep
his legs, and the emperor falls into the mud, but he blows not a hair
off the emperor's head; Olger slings the gold-bolt over the wall, but
breaks off none; Oliver gives a hundred kisses, as in the saga. The
emperor remarks each time, I hold him no champion that performs his
rouse that way. But Turpin's brag is thoroughly done; the emperor is
driven to the tower, and begs Karl to turn off the water; no more feats
shall be exacted. Now the two kaisers walk in the hall, conferring
about tribute, which Karl takes and rides away. When he reaches home
his queen welcomes him, and asks what happened at Constantinople: "Hvat
gekk af?" "This," says Karl; "I know the truth now; you shall be queen
as before, and shall have a voice in the rule."</p>

<p>It is manifest that Charlemagne's pilgrimage to Jerusalem and the visit
to the king of Constantinople, though somewhat intimately combined in
the old French <i>geste</i>, were originally distinct narratives. As far as
we can judge, nothing of the pilgrimage was retained by the English
ballad. We are not certain, even, that it is Charlemagne's visit to
Hugo upon which the ballad was formed, though the great popularity
of the French poem makes this altogether likely. As M. Gaston Paris
has said and shown,<a name="FNanchor_1_279" id="FNanchor_1_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> the visit to Hugo is one of a cycle of tales
of which the framework is this: that a king who regards himself as
the richest or most magnificent in the world is told that there is
somebody that outstrips him, and undertakes a visit to his rival to
determine which surpasses the other, threatening death to the person
who has disturbed his self-complacency, in case the rival should turn
out to be his inferior. A familiar example is afforded by the tale
of Aboulcassem, the first of the Mille et un Jours. Haroun Alraschid
was incessantly boasting that no prince in the world was so generous
as he.<a name="FNanchor_1_280" id="FNanchor_1_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> The vizier Giafar humbly exhorted the caliph not to
praise himself, but to leave that to others. The caliph, much piqued,
demanded, Do you then know anybody who compares with me? Giafar felt
compelled to reply that there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-283" id="Pg_1-283">[Pg 283]</a></span> a young man at Basra, who, though
in a private station, was not inferior even to the caliph in point of
generosity. Haroun was very angry, and, on Giafar's persisting in what
he had said, had the vizier arrested, and finally resolved to go to
Basra to see with his own eyes: if Giafar should have spoken the truth,
he should be rewarded, but in the other event he should forfeit his
life.<a name="FNanchor_1_281" id="FNanchor_1_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a></p>

<p>This story, it is true, shows no trace of the gabs which Charlemagne
and the peers make, and which Hugo requires to be accomplished on pain
of death. The gabs are a well-known North-European custom, and need
not be sought for further; but the requiring by one king of certain
feats to be executed by another under a heavy penalty is a feature of a
large class of Eastern tales of which there has already been occasion
to speak: see '<a href="#Ballad_2">The Elfin Knight</a>,' p. <a href="#Pg_1-11">11</a>. The demand in these, however,
is made not in person, but through an ambassador. The combination of a
personal visit with a task to be performed under penalty of death is
seen in the Vafþrúðnismál, where Odin, disguised as a traveller, seeks
a contest in knowledge with the wisest of the giants.<a name="FNanchor_1_282" id="FNanchor_1_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a></p>

<p>The story of the gabs has been retold in two modern imitations: very
indifferently by Nivelle de la Chaussée, 'Le Roi Hugon,' &#338;uvres,
t. V, supplément, p. 66, ed. 1778, and well by M. J. Chénier, 'Les
Miracles,' III, 259, ed. 1824.<a name="FNanchor_1_283" id="FNanchor_1_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> Uhland treated the subject
dramatically in a composition which has not been published: Keller,
Altfranzösische Sagen, 1876, Inhalt (Koschwitz).</p>

end of this ballad and the beginning of 'Sir Lionel.' 'Robin Hood's
Death,' judging by another copy, is complete within two or three

quite half a dozen stanzas are lost from both the beginning and the end

show traces in some places of Christiern Pedersen's edition of the
Danish chronicle, 1584 (Kölbing, as above, 238, 239), or of stall
prints founded on that. This does not, however, necessarily put the
ballad into the sixteenth century. Might not Pedersen have had ballad
authority for such changes and additions as he made? It may well
be supposed that he had, and if what is peculiar to Pedersen may
have come from ballads, we must hesitate to derive the ballads from
Pedersen. It is, moreover, neither strange nor unexampled that popular
ballads should be affected by tradition committed to print as well
as by tradition still floating in memory. The Färöe copies of 'Greve
Genselin,' for example, as Grundtvig remarks, I, 223, note, though
undoubtedly original and independent of Danish, evince acquaintance
with Vedel's printed text.</p></div>

The queen's demeanor may be an imitation of Charlemagne's (Arthur's)
wife's bluntness, but the <i>liaison</i> of which Cornwall boasts appears to
be vouched by no other tradition, and must be regarded as the invention
of the author of this ballad.

<p>
Arthur and three comrades return half frozen from a hunt. Arthur sits
down at the fire to warm himself. The queen taunts him: she knows a
knight who rides, winter and summer alike, in a simple shirt, chanting
love-songs the while. Arthur resolves to go out with the three the next
night to overhaul this hardy chevalier. The three attendants of the
king have an encounter with him and fare hard at his hands, but Arthur
has the advantage of the stranger, who reveals himself to the king as
Guenever's first love, by name Gasozein, and shows a token which he had
received from her.</p></div>

</div></div>

<p>
Being unable to make anything of thrub, trub, I am compelled to
conjecture <i>the rub-chadler, that rub-chandler</i>. The fiend is certainly
closed under a barrel or tub, and I suppose a rubbish barrel or tub.
Rubb, however derived, occurs in Icelandic in the sense of rubbish,
and chalder, however derived, is a Scottish form of the familiar
chaldron. Professor Skeat, with great probability, suggests that
chadler == chaudeler, chaudière. Caldaria <i>lignea</i> are cited by Ducange.
Cad or kad is well known in the sense barrel, and cadiolus, cadulus,
are found in Ducange. Cadler, chadler, however, cannot be called a
likely derivative from cad.
</p>
<p>
In stanza 48 the fiend, after he has been ousted from the
"trubchandler," is told to "lie still in that wall of stone," which is
perhaps his ordinary lair. The spy is concealed under a flight of stone
steps in the French poem; in "a large hollow stone in the door outside"
in the Welsh story; in a hollow pillar in Galien and the Rímur; in a
stone vault in the Färöe ballad: Koschwitz, Karls Reise, p. 64; Sechs

Solomon's fame is to exceed all the kings of the earth "for riches and
for wisdom;" and although the queen of Sheba came to prove him with
hard questions, she must have had the other matter also in view, for
she says, The half was not told me; thy wisdom and prosperity exceedeth

visit to the giant Geirröðr, Skáldskaparmál, 18, which terminates by
the giant's flinging a red-hot iron bar at Thor, who catches it and
sends it back through an iron pillar, through Geirröðr skulking behind
the pillar, through the wall of the house, and into the ground, a fair
matching of Charlemagne's gab. (The giant Geirröðr, like Cornwall
King, is skilled in magic.) The beginning of Biterolf and Dietleib
also recalls that of Charlemagne's Journey. Biterolf, a Spanish king,
hears from an old palmer, who has seen many a hero among Christians and
heathens, that none is the equal of Attila. Biterolf had thought that
he himself had no superior, and sets out with eleven chosen knights to
see Etzel's court with his own eyes. Romania, IX, 9 f.

Játmundr [Hlöðver], a haughty emperor in Saxon-land, sitting on his

a little: the emperor specifies his hawk, horse, and sword as quite
incomparable. That may be, says the counsellor, but his master's glory,
to be complete, requires a queen that is his peer. The suggestion of
a possible equal rouses the emperor's ire. "But since you talk such
folly, name one," he says. Sigurðr names the daughter of Hrólfr [Hugo]

<p>We have here again half a ballad, in seven fragments, but the
essentials of the story, which is well known from other versions,
happen to be preserved, or may be inferred.</p>

<p>Arthur, apparently some day after Christmas, had been encountered at
Tarn Wadling,<a name="FNanchor_1_284" id="FNanchor_1_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> in the forest of Inglewood, by a bold baron armed
with a club, who offered him the choice of fighting, or ransoming
himself by coming back on New Year's day and bringing word what women
most desire. Arthur puts this question in all quarters, and having
collected many answers, in which, possibly, he had little confidence,
he rides to keep his day. On the way he meets a frightfully ugly woman;
she intimates that she could help him. Arthur promises her Gawain
in marriage, if she will,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-289" id="Pg_1-289">[Pg 289]</a></span> and she imparts to him the right answer.
Arthur finds the baron waiting for him at the tarn, and presents
first the answers which he had collected and written down. These are
contemptuously rejected. Arthur then says that he had met a lady on
a moor, who had told him that a woman would have her will. The baron
says that the misshapen lady on the moor was his sister, and he will
burn her if he can get hold of her. Upon Arthur's return he tells his
knights that he has a wife for one of them, and they ride with the king
to see her, or perhaps for her to make her choice. When they see the
bride, they decline the match in vehement terms, all but Gawain, who is
somehow led to waive "a little foul sight and misliking." She is bedded
in all her repulsiveness, and turns to a beautiful young woman. To try
Gawain's compliance further, she asks him whether he will have her
in this likeness by night only or only by day. Putting aside his own
preference, Gawain leaves the choice to her, and this is all that is
needed to keep her perpetually beautiful. For a stepmother had witched
her to go on the wild moor in that fiendly shape until she should meet
some knight who would let her have all her will. Her brother, under a
like spell, was to challenge men either to fight with him at odds or to
answer his hard question.</p>

<p>These incidents, with the variation that Arthur (who does not show
all his customary chivalry in this ballad) waits for Gawain's consent
before he promises him in marriage, are found in a romance, probably of
the fifteenth century, printed in Madden's Syr Gawayne, and somewhat
hastily pronounced by the editor to be "unquestionably the original of
the mutilated poem in the Percy folio."<a name="FNanchor_1_285" id="FNanchor_1_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a></p>

<p>Arthur, while hunting in Ingleswood, stalked and finally shot a great
hart, which fell in a fern-brake. While the king, alone and far from
his men, was engaged in making the assay, there appeared a groom,
bearing the quaint name of Gromer Somer Joure,<a name="FNanchor_1_286" id="FNanchor_1_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> who grimly told
him that he meant now to requite him for having taken away his lands.
Arthur represented that it would be a shame to knighthood for an armed
man to kill a man in green, and offered him any satisfaction. The only
terms Gromer would grant were that Arthur should come back alone to
that place that day twelvemonth, and then tell him what women love
best; not bringing the right answer, he was to lose his head. The king
gave his oath, and they parted. The knights, summoned by the king's
bugle, found him in heavy cheer, and the reason he would at first tell
no man, but after a while took Gawain into confidence. Gawain advised
that they two should ride into strange country in different directions,
put the question to every man and woman they met, and write the answers
in a book. This they did, and each made a large collection. Gawain
thought they could not fail, but the king was anxious, and considered
that it would be prudent to spend the only month that was left in
prosecuting the inquiry in the region of Ingleswood. Gawain agreed that
it was good to be speering, and bade the king doubt not that some of
his saws should help at need.</p>

<p>Arthur rode to Ingleswood, and met a lady, riding on a
richly-caparisoned palfrey, but herself of a hideousness which beggars
words; nevertheless the items are not spared. She came up to Arthur and
told him that she knew his counsel; none of his answers would help. If
he would grant her one thing, she would warrant his life; otherwise,
he must lose his head. This one thing was that she should be Gawain's
wife. The king said this lay with Gawain; he would do what he could,
but it were a pity to make Gawain wed so foul a lady. "No matter," she
rejoined, "though I be foul: choice for a mate hath an owl. When thou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-290" id="Pg_1-290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
comest to thine answer, I shall meet thee; else art thou lost."</p>

<p>The king returned to Carlisle with a heart no lighter, and the first
man he saw was Gawain, who asked how he had sped. Never so ill: he had
met a lady who had offered to save his life, but she was the foulest he
had ever seen, and the condition was that Gawain should be her husband.
"Is that all?" said Gawain. "I will wed her once and again, though she
were the devil; else were I no friend." Well might the king exclaim,
"Of all knights thou bearest the flower!"</p>

<p>After five or six days more the time came for the answer. The king had
hardly ridden a mile into the forest when he met the lady, by name Dame
Ragnell. He told her Gawain should wed her, and demanded <i>her</i> answer.
"Some say this and some say that, but above all things women desire
to have the sovereignty; tell this to the knight; he will curse her
that told thee, for his labor is lost." Arthur, thus equipped, rode
on as fast as he could go, through mire and fen. Gromer was waiting,
and sternly demanded the answer. Arthur offered his two books, for
Dame Ragnell had told him to save himself by any of those answers if
he could. "Nay, nay, king," said Gromer, "thou art but a dead man."
"Abide, Sir Gromer, I have an answer shall make all sure. Women desire
sovereignty." "She that told thee that was my sister, Dame Ragnell; I
pray I may see her burn on a fire." And so they parted.</p>

<p>Dame Ragnell was waiting for Arthur, too, and would hear of nothing
but immediate fulfillment of her bargain. She followed the king to
his court, and required him to produce Gawain instantly, who came and
plighted his troth. The queen begged her to be married privately,
and early in the morning. Dame Ragnell would consent to no such
arrangement. She would not go to church till high-mass time, and she
would dine in the open hall. At her wedding she was dressed more
splendidly than the queen, and she sat at the head of the table at the
dinner afterwards. There her appetite was all but as horrible as her
person: she ate three capons, three curlews, and great bake meats, all
that was set before her, less and more.<a name="FNanchor_1_287" id="FNanchor_1_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p>

<p>A leaf is wanting now, but what followed is easily imagined. She chided
Gawain for his offishness, and begged him to kiss her, at least. "I
will do more," said Gawain, and, turning, beheld the fairest creature
he ever saw. But the transformed lady told him that her beauty would
not hold: he must choose whether she should be fair by night and foul
by day, or fair by day and foul by night.<a name="FNanchor_1_288" id="FNanchor_1_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> Gawain said the choice
was hard, and left all to her. "Gramercy," said the lady, "thou shalt
have me fair both day and night." Then she told him that her step-dame
had turned her into that monstrous shape by necromancy, not to recover
her own till the best knight in England had wedded her and given her
sovereignty in all points.<a name="FNanchor_1_289" id="FNanchor_1_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> A charming little scene follows, vv
715-99, in which Arthur visits Gawain in the morning, fearing lest the
fiend may have slain him. Something of this may very likely have been
in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-291" id="Pg_1-291">[Pg 291]</a></span> half page of the ballad which is lost after stanza 48.</p>

<p>Gower and Chaucer both have this tale, though with a different setting,
and with the variation, beyond doubt original in the story, that the
man whose life is saved by rightly answering the question has himself
to marry the monstrous woman in return for her prompting him.</p>

<p>Gower relates, Confessio Amantis, Book First, I, 89-104, ed. Pauli,
that Florent, nephew of the emperor, as Gawain is of Arthur, slew
Branchus, a man of high rank. Branchus's kin refrained from vengeance,
out of fear of the emperor; but a shrewd lady, grandmother to Branchus,
undertook to compass Florent's death in a way that should bring blame
upon nobody. She sent for Florent, and told him that she would engage
that he should not be molested by the family of Branchus if he could
answer a question she would ask. He was to have a proper allowance
of time to find the answer, but he was also to agree that his life
should be forfeited unless his answer were right. Florent made oath to
this agreement, and sought the opinions of the wisest people upon the
subject, but their opinions were in no accord. Considering, therefore,
that he must default, he took leave of the emperor, adjuring him to
allow no revenge to be taken if he lost his life, and went to meet his
fate. But on his way through a forest he saw an ugly old woman, who
called to him to stop. This woman told him that he was going to certain
death, and asked what he would give her to save him. He said, anything
she should ask, and she required of him a promise of marriage. That
he would not give. "Ride on to your death, then," said she. Florent
began to reflect that the woman was very old, and might be hidden
away somewhere till she died, and that there was no other chance of
deliverance, and at last pledged his word that he would marry her if it
should turn out that his life could be saved only through the answer
that she should teach him. She was perfectly willing that he should
try all other shifts first, but if they failed, then let him say that
women cared most to be sovereign in love. Florent kept back this answer
as long as he could. None of his own replies availed, and the lady who
presided in judgment at last told him that he could be allowed but one
more. Then he gave the old woman's answer, and was discharged, with a
curse on her that told.<a name="FNanchor_1_290" id="FNanchor_1_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a></p>

<p>The old woman was waiting for Florent, and he now had full leisure to
inspect all her points; but he was a knight, and would hold his troth.
He set her on his horse before him, rode by night and lay close by day,
till he came to his castle. There the ladies made an attempt to attire
her for the wedding, and she was the fouler for their pains. They were
married that night. He turned away from the bride; she prayed him not
to be so discourteous. He turned toward her, with a great moral effort,
and saw (for the chamber was full of light) a lady of eighteen, of
unequalled beauty. As he would have drawn her to him she forbade, and
said he must make his choice, to have her such by day or by night.
"Choose for us both," was his reply. "Thanks," quoth she, "for since
you have made me sovereign, I shall be both night and day as I am now."
She explained that, having been daughter of the king of Sicily, her
stepmother had forshapen her, the spell to hold till she had won the
love and the sovereignty of what knight passed all others in good name.</p>

<p>The scene of Chaucer's tale, The Wife of Bath, returns to Arthur's
court. One of the bachelors of the household, when returning from
hawking, commits a rape, for which he is condemned to death. But the
queen and other ladies intercede for him, and the king leaves his
life at the disposal of the queen. The queen, like the shrewd lady in
Gower, but with no intent to trapan the young man, says that his life
shall depend upon his being able<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-292" id="Pg_1-292">[Pg 292]</a></span> to tell her what women most desire,
and gives him a year and a day to seek an answer. He makes extensive
inquiries, but there is no region in which two creatures can be found
to be of the same mind, and he turns homeward very downcast.</p>

<p>On his way through a wood he saw a company of ladies dancing, and moved
towards them, in the hope that he might learn something. But ere he
came the dancers had vanished, and all he found was the ugliest woman
conceivable sitting on the green. She asked the knight what he wanted,
and he told her it was to know what women most desire. "Plight me thy
troth to do the next thing I ask of thee, and I will tell thee." He
gave his word, and she whispered the secret in his ear.</p>

<p>The court assembled, the queen herself sitting as justice, and the
knight was commanded to say what thing women love best. He made his
response triumphantly; there was no dissenting voice. But as soon as
he was declared to have ransomed his life, up sprang the old woman he
had met in the wood. She had taught the man his answer, he had plighted
his word to do the first thing she asked of him, and now she asked
him to make her his wife. The promise was not disputed, but the poor
youth begged her to make some other request; to take all he had in
the world, and let him go. She would not yield, and they were married
the next day. When they have gone to bed, the old wife, "smiling ever
mo," rallies her husband for his indifference, and lectures him for
objecting to ugliness, age, and vulgar birth, which things, she says,
are a great security for him, and then gives him his election, to have
her ugly and old as she is, but true, or young and fair, with the
possible contingencies. The knight has the grace to leave the decision
to her. "Then I have the sovereignty," she says, "and I will be both
fair and good; throw up the curtain and see." Fair and young she was,
and they lived to their lives' end in perfect joy.</p>

<p>Chaucer has left out the step-mother and her bewitchment, and saves,
humbles, and rewards the young knight by the agency of a good fairy;
for the ugly old woman is evidently such by her own will and for her
own purposes. She is "smiling ever mo," and has the power, as she says,
to set all right whenever she pleases. Her fate is not dependent on the
knight's compliance, though his is.</p>

<p>The Wife of Bath's Tale is made into a ballad, or what is called a
sonnet, 'Of a Knight and a Fair Virgin,' in The Crown Garland of Golden
Roses, compiled by Richard Johnson, not far from 1600: see the Percy
Society reprint, edited by W. Chappell, vol. vi of the series, p. 68.
Upon Chaucer's story is founded Voltaire's tale, admirable in its way,
of Ce qui plaît aux Dames, 1762; of which the author writes, 1765,
November 4, that it had had great success at Fontainebleau in the form
of a comic opera, entitled La Fée Urgèle.<a name="FNanchor_1_291" id="FNanchor_1_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> The amusing ballad of
The Knight and Shepherd's Daughter has much in common with the Wife of
Bath's Tale, and might, if we could trace its pedigree, go back to a
common original.<a name="FNanchor_1_292" id="FNanchor_1_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></p>

<p>Tales resembling the Marriage of Gawain must have been widely spread
during the Middle Ages. The ballad of 'King Henry' has much in common
with the one now under consideration, and Norse and Gaelic connections,
and is probably much earlier. At present I can add only one parallel
out of English, and that from an Icelandic saga.</p>

<p>Grímr was on the verge of marriage with Lopthæna, but a week before the
appointed day the bride was gone, and nobody knew what had become of
her. Her father had given her a step-mother five years before, and the
step-mother had been far from kind; but what then? Grímr was restless
and unhappy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-293" id="Pg_1-293">[Pg 293]</a></span> and got no tidings. A year of scarcity coming, he left
home with two of his people. After an adventure with four trolls, he
had a fight with twelve men, in which, though they were all slain, he
lost his comrades and was very badly wounded. As he lay on the ground,
looking only for death, a woman passed, if so she might be called;
for she was not taller than a child of seven years, so stout that
Grímr's arms would not go round her, misshapen, bald, black, ugly,
and disgusting in every particular. She came up to Grímr, and asked
him if he would accept his life from her. "Hardly," said he, "you are
so loathsome." But life was precious, and he presently consented. She
took him up and ran with him, as if he were a babe, till she came to
a large cave; there she set him down, and it seemed to Grímr that she
was uglier than before. "Now pay me for saving your life," she said,
"and kiss me." "I cannot," said Grímr, "you look so diabolical."
"Expect no help, then, from me," said she, "and I see that it will
soon be all over with you." "Since it must be, loath as I am," said
Grímr, and went and kissed her; she seemed not so bad to kiss as to
look at. When night came she made up a bed, and asked Grímr whether he
would lie alone or with her. "Alone," he answered. "Then," said she,
"I shall take no pains about healing your wounds." Grímr said he would
rather lie with her, if he had no other chance, and she bound up his
wounds, so that he seemed to feel no more of them. No sooner was Grímr
abed than he fell asleep, and when he woke, he saw lying by him almost
the fairest woman he had ever laid eyes on, and marvellously like his
true-love, Lopthæna. At the bedside he saw lying the troll-casing which
she had worn; he jumped up and burned this. The woman was very faint;
he sprinkled her with water, and she came to, and said, It is well
for both of us; I saved thy life first, and thou hast freed me from
bondage. It was indeed Lopthæna, whom the step-mother had transformed
into a horrible shape, odious to men and trolls, which she should never
come out of till a man should consent to three things,&mdash;which no man
ever would,&mdash;to accept his life at her hands, to kiss her, and to share
her bed. Gríms saga loðinkinna, Rafn, Fornaldar Sögur, II, 143-52.</p>

<p>Sir Frederic Madden, in his annotations upon this ballad, 'Syr
Gawayne,' p. 359, remarks that Sir Steven, stanza 31, does not occur in
the Round Table romances; that Sir Banier, 32, is probably a mistake
for Beduer, the king's constable; and that Sir Bore and Sir Garrett, in
the same stanza, are Sir Bors de Gauves, brother of Lionel, and Gareth,
or Gaheriet, the younger brother of Gawain.</p>

<p>'The Marriage of Sir Gawaine,' as filled out by Percy from the
fragments in his manuscript, Reliques, 1765, III, 11, is translated
by Bodmer, I, 110; by Bothe, p. 75; by Knortz, Lieder u. Romanzen
Alt-Englands, p. 135.</p>

night and a man by day?" The woman maintains her proper sovereignty,
and does not leave the decision to him: "'I would rather that thou wert

splendid fellow by day, and a hoodie at night." Campbell, Popular Tales

that Example-books may have been known in England as early as 1000,

<br />
KING HENRY</h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>'King Henry.' <b>a.</b> The Jamieson-Brown MS., fol. 31.
<b>b.</b> Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border, 1802, II, 132.</p></div>


<p>Scott describes his copy of 'King Henry' as "edited from the MS. of
Mrs Brown, corrected by a recited fragment." This MS. of Mrs Brown was
William Tytler's, in which, as we learn from Anderson's communication
to Percy (see p. 62, above), this ballad was No 11. Anderson notes
that it extended to twenty-two stanzas, the number in Scott's copy. No
account is given of the recited fragment. As published by Jamieson, II,
194, the ballad is increased by interpolation to thirty-four stanzas.
"The interpolations will be found inclosed in brackets," but a painful
contrast of style of itself distinguishes them. They were entered by
Jamieson in his manuscript as well.</p>

<p>The fourteenth stanza, as now printed, the eighteenth in Jamieson's
copy, is not there bracketed as an interpolation, and yet it is not in
the manuscript. This stanza, however, with some verbal variation, is
found in Scott's version, and as it may have been obtained by Jamieson
in one of his visits to Mrs Brown, it has been allowed to stand.</p>

<p>Lewis rewrote the William Tytler version for his Tales of Wonder,
'Courteous King Jamie,' II, 453, No 57, and it was in this shape that
the ballad first came out, 1801.</p>

<p>The story is a variety of that which is found in '<a href="#Ballad_31">The Marriage of Sir
Gawain</a>,' and has its parallel, as Scott observed, in an episode in
Hrólfr Kraki's saga; <b>A</b>, Torfæus, Historia Hrolfi Krakii, c. vii,
Havniæ, 1705; <b>B</b>, Fornaldar Sögur, Rafn, I, 30 f, c. 15.</p>

<p>King Helgi, father of Hrólfr Kraki, in consequence of a lamentable
misadventure, was living in a solitary way in a retired lodge. One
stormy Yule-night there was a loud wail at the door, after he had gone
to bed. Helgi bethought himself that it was unkingly of him to leave
anything to suffer outside, and got up and unlocked the door. There he
saw a poor tattered creature of a woman, hideously misshapen, filthy,
starved, and frozen (<b>A</b>), who begged that she might come in. The
king took her in, and bade her get under straw and bearskin to warm
herself. She entreated him to let her come into his bed, and said that
her life depended on his conceding this boon. "It is not what I wish,"
replied Helgi, "but if it is as thou sayest, lie here at the stock, in
thy clothes, and it will do me no harm." She got into the bed, and the
king turned to the wall. A light was burning, and after a while the
king took a look over his shoulder; never had he seen a fairer woman
than was lying there, and not in rags, but in a silk kirtle. The king
turned towards her now, and she informed him that his kindness had
freed her from a weird imposed by her stepmother, which she was to be
subject to till some king had admitted her to his bed, <b>A</b>. She
had asked this grace of many, but no one before had been moved to grant
it.</p>

<p>Every point of the Norse saga, except the stepmother's weird, is
found in the Gaelic tale 'Nighean Righ fo Thuinn,' 'The Daughter of
King Under-waves,' Campbell's Popular Tales of the West Highlands, No
lxxxvi, III, 403 f.</p>

<p>The Finn were together one wild night, when there was rain and snow.
An uncouth woman knocked at Fionn's door about midnight, and cried
to him to let her in under cover. "Thou strange, ugly creature, with
thy hair down to thy heels, how canst thou ask <i>me</i> to let thee in!"
he answered. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-298" id="Pg_1-298">[Pg 298]</a></span> went away, with a scream, and the whole scene was
repeated with Oisean. Then she came to Diarmaid. "Thou art hideous," he
said, "and thy hair is down to thy heels, but come in." When she had
come in, she told Diarmaid that she had been travelling over ocean and
sea for seven years, without being housed, till he had admitted her.
She asked that she might come near the fire. "Come," said Diarmaid;
but when she approached everybody retreated, because she was so
hideous. She had not been long at the fire, when she wished to be under
Diarmaid's blanket. "Thou art growing too bold," said he, "but come."
She came under the blanket, and he turned a fold of it between them.
"She was not long thus, when he gave a start, and he gazed at her, and
he saw the finest drop of blood that ever was, from the beginning of
the universe till the end of the world, at his side."</p>

<p>Mr Campbell has a fragment of a Gaelic ballad upon this story, vol.
xvii., p. 212 of his manuscript collection, 'Collun gun Cheann,' or
'The Headless Trunk,' twenty-two lines. In this case, as the title
imports, a body without a head replaces the hideous, dirty, and unkempt
draggle-tail who begs shelter of the Finn successively and obtains her
boon only from Diarmaid. See Campbell's Gaelic Ballads, p. ix.</p>

<p>The monstrous deformity of the woman is a trait in the ballad of '<a href="#Ballad_31">The
Marriage of Sir Gawain</a>,' and related stories, and is described in these
with revolting details. Her exaggerated appetite also is found in the
romance of The Wedding of Sir Gawen and Dame Ragnell, see p. 290. The
occasion on which she exhibits it is there the wedding feast, and the
scene consequently resembles, even more closely there than here, what
we meet with in the Danish ballads of 'Greve Genselin,' Grundtvig, No
16, I, 222, and 'Tord af Havsgaard,' Grundtvig, No 1, I, 1, IV, 580
(== Kristensen, 'Thors Hammer,' I, 85, No 35) the latter founded on the
þrymskviða, or Hamarsheimt, of the older Edda. In a Norwegian version
of 'Greve Genselin,' Grundtvig, IV, 732, the feats of eating and
drinking are performed not by the bride, but by an old woman who acts
as bridesmaid, brúrekvinne.<a name="FNanchor_1_293" id="FNanchor_1_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a></p>

<p>A maid who submits, at a linden-worm's entreaty, to lie in the same bed
with him, finds a king's son by her side in the morning: Grundtvig,
'Lindormen,' No 65, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, II, 213, III, 839; Kristensen,
I, 195, No 71; Afzelius, III, 121, No 88; Arwidsson, II, 270, No 139;
Hazelius, Ur de nordiska Folkens Lif, p. 117, and p. 149. In 'Ode
und de Slang',' Müllenhoff, Sagen u. s. w., p. 383, a maid, without
much reluctance, lets a snake successively come into the house, into
her chamber, and finally into her bed, upon which the snake changes
immediately into a prince.</p>

<p>Scott's copy is translated by Schubart, p. 127, and by Gerhard, p.
129; Jamieson's, without the interpolations, after Aytoun, II, 22, by
Knortz, Schottische Balladen, No 36.</p>

<p>All these versions of 'Kempy Kay' are known, or may be presumed, to
have been taken down within the first three decades of this century;
<b>A</b> is traced as many years back into the last. The fourth stanza
of <b>A</b> clearly belongs to some other ballad. Both <b>A</b> and
<b>B</b> appear to have undergone some slight changes when published
by Sharpe and Kinloch re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-301" id="Pg_1-301">[Pg 301]</a></span>spectively. Some verses from this ballad
have been adopted into one form of a still more unpleasant piece in
the Campbell collection, concerning a wife who was "the queen of all
sluts."<a name="FNanchor_1_294" id="FNanchor_1_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a></p>

<p>Sharpe remarks: "This song my learned readers will perceive to be of
Scandinavian origin, and that the wooer's name was probably suggested
by Sir Kaye's of the Round Table.... The description of Bengoleer's
daughter resembles that of the enchanted damsel who appeared to
courteous King Henrie." It is among possibilities that the ballad
was an outgrowth from some form of the story of The Marriage of Sir
Gawain, in the Percy version of which the "unseemly" lady is so rudely
commented on and rejected by Kay. This unseemly lady, in The Wedding
of Gawen and Dame Ragnell, and her counterpart in 'King Henry,' who
is of superhuman height, show an extravagant voracity which recalls
the giantess in 'Greve Genselin.' In 'Greve Genselin,' a burlesque
form of an heroic ballad which is preserved in a pure shape in three
Färöe versions (Grundtvig, IV, 737-42), there are many kemps invited
to the wedding, and in a little dance which is had the smallest kemp
is fifteen ells to [below] the knee, Grundtvig, No 16, <b>A</b> 26,
<b>B</b> 29, <b>C</b> 29. Kempy Kay has gigantic dimensions in <b>A</b>
7, <b>C</b> 9, <b>E</b> 7: teeth like tether-stakes, a nose three
[nine, five] feet long, three ells [nine yards] between his shoulders,
a span between his eyne.<a name="FNanchor_1_295" id="FNanchor_1_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> Of the bride it is said in <b>A</b> 12
that her finger nails were like the teeth of a rake and her teeth like
tether-stakes. This is not decisive; it is her ugliness, filthiness,
and laziness that are made most of. We may assume that she would be in
dimension and the shape of nature a match for the kemp, but she does
not comport herself especially like a giantess.</p>

<p>If Kempy Kay be the original name of the wooer, Knapperty and
Chickmakin might easily be derived from corrupt pronunciations like
Kampeky, Kimpaky.</p>

<p>It is not, perhaps, material to explain how Owain, "the king's son
Urien," happens to be awarded the adventure which here follows. It is
enough that his right is as good as that of other knights to whom the
same achievement has been assigned, though the romance, or, as the
phrase used to be, "the book," says nothing upon the subject. Owain's
slaying the fire-drake who was getting the better of the lion may have
led to his name becoming associated with the still more gallant exploit
of thrice kissing a fire-drake to effect a disenchantment. The ring in
<b>A</b> 9 might more plausibly be regarded as being a repetition of
that which Owain's lady gave him on leaving her for a twelvemonth's
outing, a ring which would keep him from loss of blood, and also from
prison, sickness, and defeat in battle&mdash;in short, preserve him against
all the accidents which the knight suggested might prevent his holding
his day&mdash;provided that he had it by him and thought on her. Ritson,
Ywaine and Gawin, vv 1514-38.</p>

<p>But an Icelandic saga comes near enough to the story of the ballad
as given in <b>A</b> to show where its connections lie. Alsól and a
brother and sister are all transformed by a stepmother, a handsome
woman, much, younger than her husband. Alsól's heavy weird is to be a
nondescript monster with a horse's tail, hoofs, and mane, white eyes,
big mouth, and huge hands, and never to be released from the spell till
a king's son shall consent to kiss her. One night when Hjálmtèr had
landed on a woody island, and it had fallen to him to keep watch, he
heard a great din and crashing in the woods, so that the oaks trembled.
Presently this monster came out of the thicket<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-307" id="Pg_1-307">[Pg 307]</a></span> with a fine sword in
her hand, such as he had not seen the like of. They had a colloquy,
and he asked her to let him have the sword. She said he should not
have it unless he would kiss her. "I will not kiss thy snout," said
Hjálmtèr, "for mayhap I should stick to it." But something came into
his mind which made him think better of her offer, and he said he was
ready. "You must leap upon my neck, then," she said, "when I throw up
the sword, and if you then hesitate, it will be your death." She threw
up the sword, he leaped on her neck and kissed her, and she gave him
the sword, with an augury of victory and good luck for him all his
days. The retransformation does not occur on the spot, but further on
Hjálmtèr meets Álsól as a young lady at the court of her brother, who
has also been restored to his proper form and station; everything is
explained; Hjálmtèr marries her, and his foster-brother her sister.
Hjálmtèrs ok Ölvers Saga, cc 10, 22, Rafn, Fornaldar Sögur, III, 473
ff, 514 ff.</p>

<p>In many tales of the sort a single kiss suffices to undo the spell
and reverse the transformation; in others, as in the ballad, three
are required. The triplication of the kiss has led in <b>A</b> to a
triplication of the talisman against wounds. The popular genius was
inventive enough to vary the properties of the several gifts, and we
may believe that belt, ring, and sword had originally each its peculiar
quality. The peril of touching fin or tail in <b>A</b> seems to
correspond to that in the saga of hesitating when the sword is thrown
up.</p>

<p>The <b>Danish</b> ballad, 'Jomfruen i Ormeham,' from MSS of the
sixteenth and the seventeenth century, Grundtvig, No 59, II, 177,
resembles both the first version of the Scottish ballad and the
Icelandic saga in the points that the maid offers gifts and is
rehabilitated by a kiss. The maid in her proper shape, which, it
appears, she may resume for a portion of the day, stands at Sir
Jenus's bedside and offers him gifts&mdash;five silver-bowls, all the gold
in her kist, twelve foals, twelve boats&mdash;and ends with saying, "Were
I a swain, as you are, I would betroth a maid." It is now close upon
midnight, and she hints that he must be quick. But Jenus is fast asleep
the while; twelve strikes, and the maid instantly turns into a little
snake. The page, however, has been awake, and he repeats to his master
all that has occurred.<a name="FNanchor_1_296" id="FNanchor_1_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> Sir Jenus orders his horse, rides along a
hillside, and sees the little snake in the grass. He bends over and
kisses it, and it turns to a courteous maid, who thanks him, and offers
him any boon he may ask. He asks her to be his, and as she has loved
him before this, she has no difficulty in plighting him her troth.</p>

<p>A maid transformed by a step-mother into a tree is freed by being
kissed by a man, in 'Jomfruen i Linden,' Grundtvig, II, 214, No 66,
Kristensen, II, 90, No 31; 'Linden,' Afzelius, III, 114, 118, No 87.
In 'Linden,' Kristensen, I, 13, No 5, a combination of two ballads, a
prince cuts down the linden, which changes to a linden-worm; he kisses
the worm, and a young maid stands before him.</p>

<p>A knight bewitched into the shape of a troll is restored by being
kissed by a peasant's wife thrice [once], 'Trolden og Bondens Hustru,'
Grundtvig, II, 142, No 52, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>; a prince by a kiss from
a maid, 'Lindormen,' Grundtvig, D. g. F., II, 211, No 65 <b>A</b>,
'Slangen og den lille Pige,' Danske Folkeminder, 1861, p. 15.</p>

<p>The removal of a spell which compels man or woman to appear
continuously or alternately as a monster, commonly a snake, by three
kisses or by one, is a regular feature in the numerous German tales of
Schlangenjungfrauen, Weissefrauen. Often the man is afraid to venture
the third kiss, or even a single one. See Grimm, Deutsche Sagen,

<p>Rivals or peers of Owain among romantic knights are, first, Lanzelet,
in Ulrich von Zatzikhoven's poem, who kisses a serpent on the mouth
once, which, <i>after bathing in a spring</i> (see 'Tam Lin'), becomes
the finest woman ever seen: vv 7836-7939. Brandimarte, again, in
Orlando Innamorato, lib. <span class="smcap">II</span>., c. <span class="smcap">XXVI</span>, stanzas
7-15; and Carduino, I Cantari di Carduino, Rajna, stanzas 49, 54
f, 61-64, pp 35-41. Le Bel Inconnu is an involuntary instrument in
such a disenchantment, for the snake fascinates him first and kisses
him without his knowledge; he afterwards goes to sleep, and finds a
beautiful woman standing at his head when he wakes: ed. Hippeau, p.
110 ff, v. 3101 ff. The English Libius Disconius is kist or he it
wist, and the dragon at once turns to a beautiful woman: Percy MS.,
Hales &amp; Furnivall, II, 493f; Ritson, Romances, II, 84 f. Espertius,
in Tiran le Blanc, is so overcome with fear that he cannot kiss the
dragon,&mdash;a daughter of Hippocrates, transformed by Diana, in the island
of Lango,&mdash;but Espertius not running away, as two men before him had
done, the dragon kisses him with equally good effect: Caylus, Tiran
le Blanc, II, 334-39. This particular disenchantment had not been
accomplished down to Sir John Mandeville's time, for he mentions only
the failures: Voyage and Travel, c. iv, pp 28-31, ed. 1725. Amadis
d'Astra touches two dragons on the face and breast, and restores them
to young-ladyhood: Historia del Principe Sferamundi, the 13th book of
Amadis of Gaul, P. II, c. xcvii, pp 458-462, Venice, 1610. This feat is
shown by the details to be only a variation of the story in Tiran le
Blanc.<a name="FNanchor_1_298" id="FNanchor_1_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a></p>

<p>The Rev. Mr Lamb, of Norham, communicated to Hutchinson, author of
'A View of Northumberland,' a ballad entitled 'The Laidley Worm of
Spindleston Heughs,' with this harmless preamble: "A song 500 years
old, made by the old Mountain Bard, Duncan Frasier, living on Cheviot,
<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1270. From an ancient manuscript." This composition
of Mr Lamb's&mdash;for nearly every line of it is his&mdash;is not only based
on popular tradition, but evidently preserves some small fragments
of a popular ballad, and for this reason is given in an Appendix.
There is a copy deviating but very little from the print in Kinloch's
MSS, I, 187. It was obtained from the recitation of an old woman in
Berwickshire.<a name="FNanchor_1_299" id="FNanchor_1_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> In this recited version the Child of Wynd, or Childy
Wynd (Child O-wyne), has become Child o Wane (Child O-wayn).</p>

<p>Mr R.H. Evans, in his preface to this ballad, Old Ballads, 1810, IV,
241, says that Mr Turner had informed him "that a lady upwards of
seventy had heard her mother repeat an older and nearly similar ballad."</p>

<h4>THE LAIDLEY WORM OF SPINDLESTON HEUGHS.</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A View of Northumberland, by W. Hutchinson, Anno 1776,
Newcastle, 1778, II, 162-64. Communicated by the Rev. Mr Lamb,
of Norham.</p></div>


<p>Kinloch's account of the tradition in relation to the queen, as it
maintains itself in Berwickshire, is quite in accord with German
<i>sagen</i> about enchanted ladies, innocent or guilty, and as such may be
worth giving: Kinloch MSS, I, 187.</p>

<p>"Though the ballad mentions that the queen was transformed into 'a
spiteful toad of monstrous size,' and was doomed in that form to wend
on the earth until the end of the world, yet the tradition of the
country gives another account of the endurance of her enchantment. It
is said that in form of a toad as big as a 'clockin hen' she is doomed
to expiate her guilt by confinement in a cavern in Bamborough castle,
in which she is to remain in her enchanted shape until some one shall
have the hardihood to break the spell by penetrating the cavern, whose
'invisible' door only opens every seven years, on Christmas eve. The
adventurer, after entering the cavern, must take the sword and horn
of the Childe of Wane, which hang on the wall, and having unsheathed
and resheathed the sword thrice, and wound three blasts on the horn,
he must kiss the toad three times; upon which the enchantment will be
dissolved, and the queen will recover her human form.</p>

<p>"Many adventurers, it is said, have attempted to disenchant the queen,
but have all failed, having immediately fallen into a trance, something
similar to the princes in the Arabian tale who went in search of the
Talking Bird, Singing Tree, and Yellow Water. The last one, it is
said, who made the attempt was a countryman, about sixty years ago,
who, having watched on Christmas eve the opening of the door, entered
the cavern, took the sword and horn from the wall, unsheathed and
resheathed the sword thrice, blew three blasts on the horn, and was
proceeding to the final disenchantment by kissing the toad, which he
had saluted twice, when, perceiving the various strange sleepers to
arise from the floor, his courage failed, and he fled from the cavern,
having just attained the outside of the door when it suddenly shut with
a loud clap, catching hold of the skirt of his coat, which was torn off
and left in the door.</p>

ALLISON GROSS</h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>'Allison Gross,' Jamieson-Brown MS., fol. 40.</p></div>


<p>'Allison Gross' was printed by Jamieson, Popular Ballads, II, 187,
without deviation from the manuscript save in spelling.</p>

<p>In a Greek tale, a nereid, that is elf or fairy, turns a youth who had
refused to espouse her into a snake, the curse to continue till he
finds another love who is as fair as she: 'Die Schönste,' B. Schmidt,
Griechische Märchen, etc., No 10. This tale is a variety of 'Beauty and
the Beast,' one of the numerous wild<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-314" id="Pg_1-314">[Pg 314]</a></span> growths from that ever charming
French story.<a name="FNanchor_1_300" id="FNanchor_1_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a></p>

<p>An elf, a hill-troll, a mermaid, make a young man offers of splendid
gifts, to obtain his love or the promise of his faith, in 'Elveskud,'
Grundtvig, No 47, many of the Danish and two of the Norwegian copies;
'Hertig Magnus och Elfvorna,' Afzelius, III, 172; 'Hr. Magnus og
Bjærgtrolden,' Grundtvig, No 48, Arwidsson, No 147 B; 'Herr Magnus och
Hafstrollet,' Afzelius, No 95, Bugge, No 11; a lind-worm, similarly,
to a young woman, 'Lindormen,' Grundtvig, No 65. Magnus answers the
hill-troll that he should be glad to plight faith with her were she
like other women, but she is the ugliest troll that could be found:
Grundtvig, II, 121, <b>A</b> 6, <b>B</b> 7; Arwidsson, II, 303,
<b>B</b> 5; Afzelius, III, 169, st. 5, 173, st. 6. This is like what
we read in stanza 7 of our ballad, but the answer is inevitable in any
such case. Magnus comes off scot-free.</p>

<p>The queen of the fairies undoing the spell of the witch is a remarkable
feature, not paralleled, so far as I know, in English or northern
tradition. The Greek nereids, however, who do pretty much everything,
good or bad, that is ascribed to northern elves or fairies, and even
bear an appellation resembling that by which fairies are spoken of in
Scotland and Ireland, "the good damsels," "the good ladies," have a
queen who is described as taking no part in the unfriendly acts of her
subjects, but as being kindly disposed towards mankind, and even as
repairing the mischief which subordinate sprites have done against her
will. If now the fairy queen might interpose in behalf of men against
her own kith and kin, much more likely would she be to exert herself to
thwart the malignity of a witch.<a name="FNanchor_1_301" id="FNanchor_1_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></p>

<p>The object of the witch's blowing thrice on a grass-green horn in 8<sup>2</sup>
is not clear, for nothing comes of it. In the closely related ballad
which follows this, a witch uses a horn to summon the sea-fishes, among
whom there is one who has been the victim of her spells. The horn is
appropriate. Witches were supposed to blow horns when they joined the
wild hunt, and horn-blower, "hornblâse," is twice cited by Grimm as an
equivalent to witch: Deutsche Mythologie, p. 886.</p>

<br />
THE LAILY WORM AND THE MACHREL OF THE SEA</h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Skene MS., p. 30: taken down from recitation in the north of
Scotland, in 1802 or 1803.</p></div>


<p>Somewhat mutilated, and also defaced, though it be, this ballad has
certainly never been retouched by a pen, but is pure tradition. It has
the first stanza in common with '<a href="#Ballad_34">Kemp Owyne</a>,' and shares more than that
with '<a href="#Ballad_35">Allison Gross</a>.' But it is independent of 'Allison Gross,' and has
a far more original sound.</p>

<p>Maisry's services in washing and combing are more conceivable when
rendered by a maid in her proper shape, as in 'Allison Gross,' than
when attributed to a machrel of the sea; and it is likely that the
machrel returned to her own figure every Saturday, and that this is
one of the points lost from the story. It is said, here as in 'Allison
Gross,' that Maisry kames the laily head on her knee.<a name="FNanchor_1_302" id="FNanchor_1_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> It would be
a mere cavil to raise a difficulty about combing a laily worm's head.
The fiery beast in 'Kemp Owyne,' <b>A</b>, has long hair, and the laily
worm may have had enough to be better for combing.<a name="FNanchor_1_303" id="FNanchor_1_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></p>

<p>It is only natural that the transformed maid should not wish to trust
herself again in the hands of the stepmother, but it is not according
to poetical justice that she should remain a machrel of the sea, and
here again we may suppose something to have dropped out.</p>

<p>We have had a double transformation, of sister and brother, in the
'<a href="#Ballad_31">Marriage of Gawain</a>' and in the 'Wedding of Gawen and Dame Ragnell,'
and again, with a second sister added, in the story of Álsól. Brother
and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-316" id="Pg_1-316">[Pg 316]</a></span> sister are transformed in the Danish 'Nattergalen,' Grundtvig,
No 57. It is an aggravation of stepmother malice that the victim of
enchantment, however amiable and inoffensive before, should become
truculent and destructive; so with the brother of Gawain's bride, and
with the Carl of Carlile. The stepmother is satisfactorily disposed
of, as she is in 'Kemp Owyne,' <b>B</b>, and the 'Laidly Worm of
Spindleston Heughs.'</p>

in Mrs Brown's MS."</p></div>


<p><b>A</b> is one of the nine ballads transmitted to Alexander Fraser
Tytler by Mrs Brown in April, 1800, as written down from her
recollection.<a name="FNanchor_1_304" id="FNanchor_1_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> This copy was printed by Jamieson, II, 7, in his
preface to 'True Thomas and the Queen of Elfland.' <b>B</b>, never
published as yet, has been corrupted here and there, but only by
tradition. <b>C</b> being compounded of <b>A</b> and another version,
that portion which is found in <b>A</b> is put in smaller type.</p>

<p>Thomas of Erceldoune, otherwise Thomas the Rhymer, and in the
popular style True Thomas, has had a fame as a seer, which, though
progressively narrowed, is, after the lapse of nearly or quite six
centuries, far from being extinguished. The common people throughout
the whole of Scotland, according to Mr Robert Chambers (1870), continue
to regard him with veneration, and to preserve a great number of his
prophetic sayings, which they habitually seek to connect with "dear
years" and other notable public events.<a name="FNanchor_1_305" id="FNanchor_1_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> A prediction of Thomas
of Erceldoune's is recorded in a manuscript which is put at a date
before 1320, and he is referred to with other soothsayers in the
Scalacronica, a French chronicle of English history begun in 1355.
Erceldoune is spoken of as a poet in Robert Mannyng's translation of
Langtoft's chronicle, finished in 1338; and in the Auchinleck copy of
'Sir Tristrem,' said to have been made about 1350, a Thomas is said to
have been consulted at Erþeldoun touching the history of Tristrem. So
that we seem safe in holding that Thomas of Erceldoune had a reputation
both as prophet and poet in the earlier part of the fourteenth century.
The vaticinations of Thomas are cited by various later chroniclers, and
had as much credit in England as in Scotland. "During the fourteenth,
fifteenth, and sixteenth centuries," says Chambers, "to fabricate a
prophecy in the name of Thomas the Rhymer appears to have been found
a good stroke of policy on many occasions. Thus was his authority
employed to countenance the views of Edward III against Scottish
independence, to favor the ambitious views of the Duke of Albany in the
minority of James V, and to sustain the spirits of the nation under
the harassing invasions of Henry VIII." During the Jacobite rising of
1745 the accomplishment of Thomas's as then unfulfilled predictions
was looked for by many. His prophecies, and those of other Scotch
soothsayers, were consulted, says Lord Hailes, "with a weak if not
criminal curiosity." Even as late as the French revolutionary war a
rhyme of Thomas's caused much distress and consternation in the border
counties of Scotland, where people were fearing an invasion. The 'Whole
Prophecie' of Merlin, Thomas Rymour, and others, collected and issued
as early as 1603, continued to be printed as a chap-book down to the
beginning of this century, when, says Dr Murray, few farm-houses in
Scotland were without a copy of it. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-318" id="Pg_1-318">[Pg 318]</a></span></p>

<p>All this might have been if Thomas of Erceldoune had been not more
historical than Merlin. But the name is known to have belonged to a
real person. Thomas Rymor de Ercildune is witness to a deed whereby one
Petrus de Haga obliges himself to make a certain payment to the Abbey
of Melrose. Petrus de Haga is, in turn, witness to a charter made by
Richard de Moreville. Unluckily, neither of these deeds is dated. But
Moreville was constable of Scotland from 1162 to 1189. If we suppose
Moreville's charter to have been given towards 1189, and Haga to have
been then about twenty years old, and so born about 1170, and further
suppose Haga to have made his grant to Melrose towards the end of a
life of threescore, or three score and ten, the time of Thomas Rymer's
signature would be about 1230 or 1240. If Thomas Rymer was then twenty
years of age, his birth would have been at 1210 or 1220. In the year
1294 Thomas de Ercildoun, son and heir of Thomas Rymour de Ercildoun,
conveyed to a religious house his inheritance of lands in Ercildoun.
With Thomas Rhymer in mind, one naturally interprets Thomas Rymour
as the prophet and Thomas de Ercildoun as his son. If Rymour was the
surname of this family,<a name="FNanchor_1_306" id="FNanchor_1_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> it would have been better, for us at
least, if the surname had been subjoined to the first Thomas also. As
the language stands, we are left to choose among several possibilities.
Thomas the Rhymer may have been dead in 1294; Thomas Rymour, meaning
the same person, may have made this cession of lands in 1294, and
have survived still some years. Thomas, the father, may, as Dr Murray
suggests, have retired from the world, but still be living, and it may
be his son who resigns the lands. Blind Harry's Life of Wallace makes
Thomas Rimour to be alive down to 1296 or 1297. A story reported by
Bower in his continuation of Fordun, c. 1430, makes Thomas to have
predicted the death of Alexander III in 1286, when, according to the
previous (necessarily very loose) calculation, the seer would have
been between sixty-six and seventy-six. Neither of these last dates
is established by the strongest evidence, but there is no reason for
refusing to admit, at least, that Thomas of Erceldoune may have been
alive at the latter epoch.</p>

<p>Thomas of Erceldoune's prophetic power was a gift of the queen of
the elves; the modern elves, equally those of northern Europe and of
Greece, resembling in respect to this attribute the nymphs of the
ancient Hellenic mythology. How Thomas attained this grace is set forth
in the first of three fits of a poem which bears his name. This poem
has come down in four somewhat defective copies: the earliest written
a little before the middle of the fifteenth century, two others about
1450, the fourth later. There is a still later manuscript copy of the
second and third fits.<a name="FNanchor_1_307" id="FNanchor_1_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> All the manuscripts are English, but it
is manifest from the nature of the topics that the original poem was
the work of a Scotsman. All four of the complete versions speak of an
older story: 'gyff it be als the storye sayes,' v. 83, 'als the storye
tellis full ryghte,' v. 123. The older story, if any, must be the work
of Thomas. The circumstance that the poem, as we have it, begins in
the first person, and after a long passage returns for a moment to the
first person, though most of the tale is told in the third, is of no
importance; nor would it have been important if the whole narrative had
been put into Thomas's mouth, since that is the simplest of literary
artifices.</p>

<p>Thomas, having found favor with the queen of Elfland, was taken with
her to that country, and there he remained more than three [seven]
years. Then the time came round when a tribute had to be paid to hell,
and as Thomas was too likely to be chosen by the fiend, the elf queen
conducted him back to the world of men. At the moment of parting Thomas
desires some token which may authenticate his having spoken with her.
She gives him the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-319" id="Pg_1-319">[Pg 319]</a></span> gift of soothsaying. He presses her to stay and
tell him some ferly. Upon this she begins a train of predictions,
which Thomas more than once importunes her to continue. The first two
of these, the failure of Baliol's party and the battle of Halidon
Hill, 1333, stand by themselves, but they are followed by a series
in chronological order, extending from the battle of Falkirk to the
battle of Otterbourn, 1298-1388. The third fit, excepting, perhaps, a
reference to Henry IV's invasion of Scotland in 1401, seems to consist,
not of predictions made after the event, but of "adaptations of
legendary prophecies, traditionally preserved from far earlier times,
and furbished up anew at each period of national trouble and distress,
in expectation of their fulfilment being at length at hand."<a name="FNanchor_1_308" id="FNanchor_1_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a></p>

<p>The older "story," which is twice referred to in the prologue to the
prophecies of Thomas of Erceldoune, was undoubtedly a romance which
narrated the adventure of Thomas with the elf queen <i>simply</i>, without
specification of his prophecies. In all probability it concluded, in
accordance with the ordinary popular tradition, with Thomas's return
to fairy-land after a certain time passed in this world.<a name="FNanchor_1_309" id="FNanchor_1_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> For the
story of Thomas and the Elf-queen is but another version of what is
related of Ogier le Danois and Morgan the Fay. Six fairies made gifts
to Ogier at his birth. By the favor of five he was to be the strongest,
the bravest, the most successful, the handsomest, the most susceptible,
of knights: Morgan's gift was that, after a long and fatiguing career
of glory, he should live with her at her castle of Avalon, in the
enjoyment of a still longer youth and never wearying pleasures. When
Ogier had passed his hundredth year, Morgan took measures to carry out
her promise. She had him wrecked, while he was on a voyage to France,
on a loadstone rock conveniently near to Avalon, which Avalon is a
little way this side of the terrestrial paradise. In due course he
comes to an orchard, and there he eats an apple, which affects him so
peculiarly that he looks for nothing but death. He turns to the east,
and sees a beautiful lady, magnificently attired. He takes her for
the Virgin; she corrects his error, and announces herself as Morgan
the Fay. She puts a ring on his finger which restores his youth, and
then places a crown on his head which makes him forget all the past.
For two hundred years Ogier lived in such delights as no worldly being
can imagine, and the two hundred years seemed to him but twenty.
Christendom was then in danger, and even Morgan thought his presence
was required in the world. The crown being taken from his head, the
memory of the past revived, and with it the desire to return to France.
He was sent back by the fairy, properly provided, vanquished the foes
of Christianity in a short space, and after a time was brought back by
Morgan the Fay to Avalon.<a name="FNanchor_1_310" id="FNanchor_1_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></p>

<p>The fairy adventures of Thomas and of Ogier have the essential points
in common, and even the particular trait that the fairy is taken to be
the Virgin. The occurrence of this trait again in the ballad, viewed in
connection with the general similarity of the two, will leave no doubt
that the ballad had its source in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-320" id="Pg_1-320">[Pg 320]</a></span> romance. Yet it is an entirely
popular ballad as to style,<a name="FNanchor_1_311" id="FNanchor_1_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> and must be of considerable age,
though the earliest version (<b>A</b>) can be traced at furthest only
into the first half of the last century.</p>

<p>The scene of the meeting of Thomas with the elf queen is Huntly Banks
and the Eildon Tree in versions <b>B</b>, <b>C</b> of the ballad, as
in the romance.<a name="FNanchor_1_312" id="FNanchor_1_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> Neither of these is mentioned in <b>A</b>, the
reciter of which was an Aberdeen woman. The elf-lady's costume and
equipment, minutely given in the romance (henceforth referred to as
<b>R</b>), are reduced in the ballad to a skirt of grass-green silk
and a velvet mantle, <b>A</b>, and a dapple-gray horse, <b>B</b> 2
(<b>R</b> 5), with nine and fifty bells on each tett of its mane,
<b>A</b> 2 (three bells on either side of the bridle, <b>R</b> 9).<a name="FNanchor_1_313" id="FNanchor_1_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a>
Thomas salutes the fairy as queen of heaven, <b>A</b> 3, <b>R</b> 11.
<b>B</b> 3 has suffered a Protestant alteration which makes nonsense
of the following stanza. She corrects his mistake in all, and in
<b>B</b> 4 tells him she is out hunting, as in <b>R</b> 16. As <b>C</b>
5 stands, she challenges Thomas to kiss her, warning him at the same
time, unnaturally, and of course in consequence of a corrupt reading,
of the danger; which Thomas defies, <b>C</b> 6. These two stanzas in
<b>C</b> represent the passage in the romance, 17-21, in which Thomas
embraces the fairy queen, and are wanting in <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, though
not to be spared. It is contact with the fairy that gives her the power
to carry her paramour off; for carry him off she does, and he is in
great fright at having to go. The ballad is no worse, and the romance
would have been much better, for the omission of another passage,
impressive in itself, but incompatible with the proper and original
story. The elf-queen had told Thomas that he would ruin her beauty, if
he had his will, and so it came to pass: her eyes seemed out, her rich
clothing was away, her body was like the lead; and it is while thus
disfigured that she bids Thomas take leave of sun and moon, so that his
alarm is not without reason.<a name="FNanchor_1_314" id="FNanchor_1_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> He must go with her for seven years,
<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>; only for a twelvemonth, <b>R</b>. She takes him up
behind her, <b>A</b>; she rides and he runs, <b>B</b>; she leads him
in at Eldon hill, <b>R</b>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-321" id="Pg_1-321">[Pg 321]</a></span> they cross a water, he wading up to the
knee, <b>B</b>, <b>R</b>. The water is subterranean in <b>R</b>, and
for three days naught is heard but the soughing of the flood. Then they
come to an orchard, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>R</b>, and Thomas, like to
tyne for lack of food, is about to pull fruit, but is told that the
fruit is cursed, <b>A</b> 9, <b>B</b> 8;<a name="FNanchor_1_315" id="FNanchor_1_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> if he plucks it, his soul
goes to the fire of hell, <b>R</b> 35. The fairy has made a provision
of safe bread and wine for him in the ballad, <b>A</b> 10, <b>B</b>
9, but he has still to fast a while in the romance. <b>C</b>, which
lacks this passage, makes them ride till they reach a wide desert, and
leave living land behind, 9; and here (but in <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, and
<b>R</b> in the vicinity of the orchard) the fairy bids Thomas lay his
head on her knee, and she will show him rare sights. These are the way
to heaven, <b>A</b> 12, <b>B</b> 11, <b>R</b> 38; the way to hell,
<b>A</b> 13, <b>B</b> 10, <b>R</b> 41; the road to Elfland, whither
they are going, <b>A</b> 14. <b>R</b> does not point out the road to
Elfland, but the elf-queen's castle on a high hill; and there are two
additional ferlies, the way to paradise and the way to purgatory,<a name="FNanchor_1_316" id="FNanchor_1_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a>
39, 40. Thomas, in <b>A</b> 15, is now admonished that he must hold
his tongue, for if he speaks a word he will never get back to his own
country; in <b>R</b> 44 he is told to answer none but the elf-queen,
whatever may be said to him, and this course he takes in <b>B</b> 12.
But before they proceed to the castle the lady resumes all the beauty
and splendor which she had lost, and no explanation is offered save
the naive one in the Lansdowne copy, that if she had not, the king,
her consort, would have known that she had been in fault. Now follows
in <b>A</b> 15 (as recited, here 7), <b>C</b> 15, 16, the passage
through the subterranean water, which should come before they reach the
orchard, as in <b>B</b> 6, <b>R</b> 30, 31. There is much exaggeration
in the ballad: they wade through rivers in darkness and hear the
sea roaring, <b>C</b> 15, <b>A</b> 7, as in <b>R</b>, but they also
wade through red blood to the knee, <b>A</b> 7, <b>C</b> 16, and the
crossing occupies not three days, as in <b>R</b> 31, but forty days,
<b>A</b> 7. In <b>C</b> they <i>now</i> come to the garden. Stanzas 15, 16
are out of place in <b>C</b>, as just remarked, and 17 is entirely
perverted. The cursed fruit which Thomas is not to touch in <b>A</b> 9,
<b>B</b> 8, <b>R</b> 35, is offered him by the elf-queen as his wages,
and will give him the tongue that can never lie,&mdash;a gift which is made
him in the romance at the beginning of the second fit, when the fairy
is preparing to part with him. Stanzas 18,19 of <b>C</b> are certainly
a modern, and as certainly an ill-devised, interpolation. <b>B</b>
has lost the conclusion. In <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, Thomas gets a fairy
costume, and is not seen on earth again for seven years.</p>

<p>The romance, after some description of the life at the elf-castle,
informs us that Thomas lived there more than three years [Cambridge
MS., seven], and thought the time but a space of three days, an almost
moderate illusion compared with the experience of other mortals under
analogous circumstances.<a name="FNanchor_1_317" id="FNanchor_1_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> The fairy queen then hurried him away,
on the eve of the day when the foul fiend was to come to fetch his
tribute. He was a mickle man and hend, and there was every reason to
fear that he would be chosen. She brought him again to Eldon Tree,
and was bidding him farewell. Thomas begged of her a token of his
conversation with her, and she gave him the gift of true speaking. He
urged her further to tell him some ferly, and she made him several
predictions, but he would not let her go without more and more.
Finally, with a promise to meet him on Huntly Banks when she might, she
left him under the tree. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-322" id="Pg_1-322">[Pg 322]</a></span></p>

<p>Popular tradition, as Sir Walter Scott represents, held that, though
Thomas was allowed to revisit the earth after a seven years' sojourn
in fairy-land, he was under an obligation to go back to the elf-queen
whenever she should summon him. One day while he "was making merry with
his friends in the town of Erceldoune, a person came running in, and
told, with marks of fear and astonishment, that a hart and hind had
left the neighboring forest, and were composedly and slowly parading
the street of the village. The prophet instantly arose, left his
habitation, and followed the wonderful animals to the forest, whence he
was never seen to return." He is, however, expected to come back again
at some future time.</p>

<p>What we learn from the adventures of Thomas concerning the perils of
dealing with fairies, and the precautions to be observed, agrees with
the general teaching of tradition upon the subject. In this matter
there is pretty much one rule for all "unco" folk, be they fairies,
dwarfs, water-sprites, devils, or departed spirits, and, in a limited
way, for witches, too. Thomas, having kissed the elf-queen's lips,
must go with her. When the dead Willy comes to ask back his faith and
troth of Margaret, and she says he must first kiss her, cheek and chin,
he replies, "If I should kiss your red, red lips, your days would not
be long."<a name="FNanchor_1_318" id="FNanchor_1_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> When Thomas is about to pull fruit in the subterranean
garden, or paradise, the elf bids him let be: all the plagues of hell
light on the fruit of this country; "if thou pluck it, thy soul goes to
the fire of hell."<a name="FNanchor_1_319" id="FNanchor_1_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> The queen had taken the precaution of bringing
some honest bread and wine with her for Thomas's behoof. So when Burd
Ellen's brother sets out to rescue his sister, who had been carried
off by the king of Elfland, his sage adviser enjoins him to eat and
drink nothing in fairy-land, whatever his hunger or thirst; "for if
he tasted or touched in Elfland, he must remain in the power of the
elves, and never see middle-eard again."<a name="FNanchor_1_320" id="FNanchor_1_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> Abstinence from speech is
equally advisable, according to our ballad and to other authority: Gin
ae word you should chance to speak, you will neer get back to your ain
countrie, <b>A</b> 15. They've asked him questions, one and all, but he
answered none but that fair ladie, <b>B</b> 12. What so any man to thee
say, look thou answer none but me, <b>R</b> 44.</p>

<p>That eating and drinking, personal contact, exchange of speech,
receiving of gifts, in any abode of unearthly beings, including the
dead, will reduce a man to their fellowship and condition might be
enforced by a great number of examples, and has already been abundantly
shown by Professor Wilhelm Müller in his beautiful essay, Zur Symbolik
der deutschen Volkssage.<a name="FNanchor_1_321" id="FNanchor_1_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> The popular belief of the northern
nations in this matter is more completely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-323" id="Pg_1-323">[Pg 323]</a></span> shown than anywhere else in
Saxo's account of King Gormo's visit to Guthmund, and it will be enough
to cite that. The Danish King Gormo, having heard extraordinary things
of the riches of Geruth (the giant Geirröðr), determines to verify
the reports with his own eyes, under the guidance of Thorkill, from
whom he has received them. The land of Geruth is far to the northeast,
beyond the sun and stars, and within the realm of Chaos and Old Night.
It is, in fact, a very dismal and terrific sort of Hades. The way to
it lies through the dominion of Guthmund, Geruth's brother, which is
described as a paradise, but a paradise of the same dubious attractions
as that in Thomas of Erceldoune. Guthmund, himself a giant, receives
the travellers, a band of about three hundred, very graciously, and
conducts them to his palace. Thorkill takes his comrades apart, and
puts them on their guard: they must eat and drink nothing that is
offered them, but live on the provisions which they have brought, must
keep off from the people of the place and not touch them; if they
partake of any of the food, they will forget everything, and have to
pass their lives in this foul society. Guthmund complains that they
slight his hospitality, but Thorkill, now and always, has an excuse
ready. The genial monarch offers Gormo one of his twelve beautiful
daughters in marriage, and their choice of wives to all the rest of
the train. Most of the Danes like the proposition, but Thorkill renews
his warnings. Four take the bait, and lose all recollection of the
past. Guthmund now commends the delicious fruits of his garden, and
tries every art to make the king taste them. But he is again foiled by
Thorkill, and clearly perceiving that he has met his match, transports
the travellers over the river which separates him and his brother, and
allows them to continue their journey.<a name="FNanchor_1_322" id="FNanchor_1_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a></p>

texts corrupt the names of persons and of places, and alter the results
of battles. Dr Murray remarks: "The oldest text makes the Scots win
Halidon Hill, with the slaughter of six thousand Englishmen, while
the other texts, wise after the fact, makes the Scots lose, as they
actually did." This, and the consideration that a question about the
conflict between the families of Bruce and Baliol would not be put
after 1400, when the Baliol line was extinct, disposes Dr Murray to
think that verses 326-56 of the second fit, with perhaps the first fit,
the conclusion of the poem, and an indefinite portion of fit third, may
have been written on the eve of Halidon Hill, with a view to encourage
the Scots.</p></div>

be cleared up by the poem of The Visions of Ogier in Fairy Land. The
book is thus described by Brunet, ed. 1863, IV, 173: Le premier (second
et troisième) livre des visions d'Oger le Dannoys au royaulme de
Fairie, Paris, 1542, pet. in-8, de 48 ff. Brunet adds: A la suite de ce
poëme, dans l'exemplaire de la Bibliothèque impériale, se trouve, Le
liure des visions fantastiques, Paris, 1542, pet. in-8, de 24 ff. The
National Library is not now in possession of the volume; nor have all
the inquiries I have been able to make, though most courteously aided
in France, resulted, as I hoped, in the finding of a copy.</p></div>

version (<b>C</b>) concludes. "The repugnance of Thomas to be debarred
the use of falsehood when he should find it convenient," may have,
as Scott says, "a comic effect," but is, for a ballad, a miserable
conceit. Both ballad and romance are serious.</p></div>

("manes hung wi whustles that the win played on," p. 299). The fairy's
saddle has a bordure of bells in the English Launfal, Halliwell's
Illustrations of Fairy Mythology, p. 31, but not in Marie's lai. The
dwarf-king Antiloie, in Ulrich Von Eschenbach's Alexander, has bells on
his bridle: Grimm, Deutsche Mythologie, I, 385. These bells, however,
are not at all distinctive of fairies, but are the ordinary decoration
of elegant "outriders" in the Middle Ages, especially of women. In the
romance of Richard C&#339;ur de Lion, a messenger's trappings ring with
five hundred bells. Besides the bridle, bells were sometimes attached
to the horse's breastplate, to the saddle-bow, crupper, and stirrups.
Conde Claros's steed has three hundred around his breastplate. See
Weber's Metrical Romances, R.C. de Lion, vv 1514-17, 5712-14, cited by
T. Wright, History of Domestic Manners in England, 214 f; Liebrecht,
Gervasius, p. 122; Kölbing, Englische Studien, III, 105; Zupitza and

Ogier, with which the author of Thomas of Erceldoune has blended a
very serious one, without any regard to the irreconcilableness of the
two. He is presently forced to undo this melancholy transformation
of the fairy, as we shall see. Brandl, 'Thomas of Erceldoune,' p.
20, cites from Giraldus Cambrensis, Itinerarium Cambriæ, I, 5, a
story about one Meilyr, a Welshman, the like of which our poet had in
mind. This Meilyr was a great soothsayer, and "owed his skill to the
following adventure:" Being in company one evening with a girl for
whom he had long had a passion, desideratis amplexibus atque deliciis
cum indulsisset, statim loco puellæ formosæ formam quamdam villosam,
hispidam et hirsutam, adeoque enormiter deformem invenit, quod in
ipso ejusdem aspectu dementire c&#339;pit et insanire. Meilyr recovered
his reason after several years, through the merits of the saints, but
always kept up an intimacy with unclean spirits, and by their help
foretold the future. It is not said that they gave him the tongue that
never could lie, but no other tongue could lie successfully in his
presence: he always saw a little devil capering on it. He was able, by
similar indications, to point out the lies and errors of books. The
experiment being once tried of laying the Gospel of John in his lap,
every devil instantly decamped. Geoffrey of Monmouth's history was
substituted, and imps swarmed all over the book and him, too.</p></div>

ordinary hyperbole of lovers: two hundred years seemed but twenty.
The British king Herla lived with the king of the dwarfs more than
two hundred years, and thought the time but three days: Walter Mapes,
Nugæ Curialium, ed. Wright, p. 16 f (Liebrecht). The strongest case,
I believe, is the exquisite legend, versified by Trench, of the monk,
with whom three hundred years passed, while he was listening to a
bird's song&mdash;as he thought, less than three hours. For some of the
countless repetitions of the idea, see Pauli's Schimpf und Ernst, ed.

Müller, p. 373. Shakspere has this: "They are fairies; he that speaks
to them shall die;" Falstaff, in Merry Wives of Windsor, V, 5.
Ancient Greek tradition is not without traces of the same ideas. It
was Persephone's eating of the pomegranate kernel that consigned her
to the lower world, in spite of Zeus and Demeter's opposition. The
drinking of Circe's brewage and the eating of lotus had an effect on
the companions of Ulysses such as is sometimes ascribed to the food
and drink of fairies, or other demons, that of producing forgetfulness
of home: Odyssey, <span class="smcap">X</span>, 236, <span class="smcap">IX</span>, 97. But it would not
be safe to build much on this. A Hebrew tale makes the human wife of a
demon charge a man who has come to perform, a certain service for the
family not to eat or drink in the house, or to take any present of her
husband, exactly repeating the precautions observed in Grimm, Deutsche
Sagen, Nos 41, 49: Tendlan, Das Buch der Sagen und Legenden jüdischer
Vorzeit, p. 141. The children of Shem may probably have derived this
trait in the story from the children of Japhet. Aladdin, in the Arabian
Nights, is to have a care, above all things, that he does not touch the
walls of the subterranean chamber so much as with his clothes, or he
will die instantly. This again, by itself, is not very conclusive.</p></div>

<p>This extremely airy and sparkling little ballad varies but slightly in
the half dozen known copies. The one in the Musical Museum, No 370, p.
382, and that in Ritson's Scotish Songs, II, 139, are reprinted from
Herd.</p>

<p>Singularly enough, there is a poem in eight-line stanzas, in a
fourteenth-century manu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-330" id="Pg_1-330">[Pg 330]</a></span>script, which stands in somewhat the same
relation to this ballad as the poem of Thomas of Erceldoune does to the
ballad of Thomas Rymer, but with the important difference that there is
no reason for deriving the ballad from the poem in this instance. There
seems to have been an intention to make it, like Thomas of Erceldoune,
an introduction to a string of prophecies which follows, but no
junction has been effected. This poem is given in an appendix.</p>

<p>The first twenty-two stanzas of <b>B</b> differ from the corresponding
ones in <b>A</b>, 1-23, omitting 16, by only a few words, and there
are other agreements in the second half of these versions. Burns's
intimacy with Robert Riddell would naturally lead to a communication
from one to the other; but both may have derived the verses that are
common from the same third party. Herd's fragment, <b>C</b>, was the
earliest printed. Scott's version, <b>I</b>, as he himself states,
was compounded of the Museum copy, Riddell's, Herd's, and "several
recitals from tradition." <b>I b</b>, the edition of 1802, contained
fragments of 'The Bromfield Hill' and of '<a href="#Ballad_38">The Wee Wee Man</a>,' which were
dropped from the later edition; but unfortunately this later edition
was corrupted with eleven new stanzas, which are not simply somewhat of
a modern cast as to diction, as Scott remarks, but of a grossly modern
invention, and as unlike popular verse as anything can be. <b>I</b> is
given according to the later edition, with those stanzas omitted; and
all that is peculiar to this version, and not taken from the Museum,
Glenriddell, or Herd, is distinguished from the rest by the larger
type. This, it will be immediately seen, is very
little.</p>

<p>The copy in Tales of Wonder, II, 459, is <b>A</b>, altered by Lewis.
Mr Joseph Robertson notes, Kinloch MSS, VI, 10, that his mother had
communicated to him some fragments of this ballad slightly differing
from Scott's version, with a substitution of the name True Tammas for
Tam Lane.</p>

<p>The Scots Magazine for October, 1818, LXXXII, 327-29, has a "fragment"
of more than sixty stanzas, composed in an abominable artificial lingo,
on the subject of this ballad, and alleged to have been taken from
the mouth of a good old peasant, who, not having heard the ballad for
thirty years, could remember no more. Thomas the Rhymer appears in the
last lines with very great distinction, but it is not clear what part
he has in the story.<a name="FNanchor_1_323" id="FNanchor_1_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> </p>

<p>Sir Walter Scott relates a tradition of an attempt to rescue a woman
from fairydom which recalls the ill success of many of the efforts to
disenchant White Ladies in Germany: "The wife of a farmer in Lothian
had been carried off by the fairies, and, during the year of probation,
repeatedly appeared on Sunday, in the midst of her children, combing
their hair. On one of these occasions she was accosted by her husband;
when she related to him the unfortunate event which had separated
them, instructed him by what means he might win her, and exhorted him
to exert all his courage, since her temporal and eternal happiness
depended on the success of his attempt. The farmer, who ardently loved
his wife, set out at Halloween, and, in the midst of a plot of furze,
waited impatiently for the procession of the fairies. At the ringing of
the fairy bridles, and the wild, unearthly sound which accompanied the
cavalcade, his heart failed him, and he suffered the ghostly train to
pass by without interruption. When the last had rode past, the whole
troop vanished, with loud shouts of laughter and exultation, among
which he plainly discovered the voice of his wife, lamenting that he
had lost her forever." The same author proceeds to recount a real
incident, which took place at the town of North Berwick, within memory,
of a man who was prevented from undertaking, or at least meditating, a
similar rescue only by shrewd and prompt practical measures on the part
of his minister.<a name="FNanchor_1_325" id="FNanchor_1_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a></p>

<p>This fine ballad stands by itself, and is not, as might have been
expected, found in possession of any people but the Scottish. Yet
it has connections, through the principal feature in the story, the
retransformation of Tam Lin, with Greek popular tradition older than
Homer.</p>

<p>Something of the successive changes of shape is met with in a
Scandinavian ballad: 'Nattergalen,' Grundtvig, II, 168, No 57;
'Den förtrollade Prinsessan,' Afzelius, II, 67, No 41, Atterbom,
Poetisk Kalender, 1816, p. 44; Dybeck, Runa, 1844, p. 94, No 2;
Axelson, Vandring i Wermlands Elfdal, p. 21, No 3; Lindeman, Norske
Fjeldmelodier, Tekstbilag til 1ste Bind, p. 3, No 10.</p>

<p>Though many copies of this ballad have been obtained from the mouth
of the people, all that are known are derived from flying sheets, of
which there is a Danish one dated 1721 and a Swedish of the year 1738.
What is of more account, the style of the piece, as we have it, is
not quite popular. Nevertheless, the story is entirely of the popular
stamp, and so is the feature in it, which alone concerns us materially.
A nightingale relates to a knight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-337" id="Pg_1-337">[Pg 337]</a></span> how she had once had a lover, but
a step-mother soon upset all that, and turned her into a bird and her
brother into a wolf. The curse was not to be taken off the brother till
he drank of his step-dame's blood, and after seven years he caught
her, when she was taking a walk in a wood, tore out her heart, and
regained his human shape. The knight proposes to the bird that she
shall come and pass the winter in his bower, and go back to the wood in
the summer: this, the nightingale says, the step-mother had forbidden,
as long as she wore feathers. The knight seizes the bird by the foot,
takes her home to his bower, and fastens the windows and doors. She
turns to all the marvellous beasts one ever heard of,&mdash;to a lion, a
bear, a variety of small snakes, and at last to a loathsome lind-worm.
The knight makes a sufficient incision for blood to come, and a maid
stands on the floor as fair as a flower. He now asks after her origin,
and she answers, Egypt's king was my father, and its queen my mother;
my brother was doomed to rove the woods as a wolf. "If Egypt's king,"
he rejoins, "was your father, and its queen your mother, then for sure
you are my sister's daughter, who was doomed to be a nightingale."<a name="FNanchor_1_326" id="FNanchor_1_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a></p>

<p>We come much nearer, and indeed surprisingly near, to the principal
event of the Scottish ballad in a Cretan fairy-tale, cited from
Chourmouzis by Bernhard Schmidt.<a name="FNanchor_1_327" id="FNanchor_1_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> A young peasant of the village
Sgourokepháli, who was a good player on the rote, used to be taken
by the nereids into their grotto for the sake of his music. He fell
in love with one of them, and, not knowing how to help himself, had
recourse to an old woman of his village. She gave him this advice: that
just before cock-crow he should seize his beloved by the hair, and hold
on, unterrified, till the cock crew, whatever forms she should assume.
The peasant gave good heed, and the next time he was taken into the
cave fell to playing, as usual, and the nereids to dancing. But as
cock-crow drew nigh, he put down his instrument, sprang upon the object
of his passion, and grasped her by her locks. She instantly changed
shape; became a dog, a snake, a camel, fire. But he kept his courage
and held on, and presently the cock crew, and the nereids vanished all
but one. His love returned to her proper beauty, and went with him to
his home. After the lapse of a year she bore a son, but in all this
time never uttered a word. The young husband was fain to ask counsel of
the old woman again, who told him to heat the oven hot, and say to his
wife that if she would not speak he would throw the boy into the oven.
He acted upon this prescription; the nereid cried out, Let go my child,
dog! tore the infant from his arms, and vanished.</p>

<p>This Cretan tale, recovered from tradition even later than our ballad,
repeats all the important circumstances of the forced marriage of
Thetis with Peleus. Chiron, like the old woman, suggested to his
protégé that he should lay hands on the nereid, and keep his hold
through whatever metamorphosis she might make. He looked out for his
opportunity and seized her; she turned to fire, water, and a wild
beast, but he did not let go till she resumed her primitive shape.
Thetis, having borne a son, wished to make him immortal; to which end
she buried him in fire by night, to burn out his human elements, and
anointed him with ambrosia by day. Peleus was not taken into counsel,
but watched her, and saw the boy gasping in the fire, which made him
call out; and Thetis, thus thwarted, abandoned the child and went back
to the nereids. Apollodorus, Bibliotheca, III, 13, 5, 6.</p>

<p>The Cretan tale does not differ from the one repeated by Apollodorus
from earlier writers a couple of thousand years ago more than two
versions of a story gathered from oral tradition in these days are
apt to do. Whether it has come down to our time from mouth to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-338" id="Pg_1-338">[Pg 338]</a></span> mouth
through twenty-five centuries or more, or whether, having died out
of the popular memory, it was reintroduced through literature, is a
question that cannot be decided with certainty; but there will be
nothing unlikely in the former supposition to those who bear in mind
the tenacity of tradition among people who have never known books.<a name="FNanchor_1_328" id="FNanchor_1_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a></p>

<p>has an occult and very important significance which has only very
lately been pointed out, and which modern reciters had completely lost
knowledge of, as appears by the disorder into which the stanzas have
fallen.<a name="FNanchor_1_329" id="FNanchor_1_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> Immersion in a liquid, generally water, but sometimes
milk, is a process requisite for passing from a non-human shape,
produced by enchantment, back into the human, and also for returning
from the human to a non-human state, whether produced by enchantment
or original. We have seen that the serpent which Lanzelet kisses, in
Ulrich's romance, is not by that simple though essential act instantly
turned into a woman. It is still necessary that she should bathe in
a spring (p. 308). In an Albanian tale, 'Taubenliebe,' Hahn, No 102,
II, 130, a dove flies into a princess's window, and, receiving her
caresses, asks, Do you love me? The princess answering Yes, the dove
says, Then have a dish of milk ready to-morrow, and you shall see what
a handsome man I am. A dish of milk is ready the next morning; the dove
flies into the window, dips himself in the milk, drops his feathers,
and steps out a beautiful youth. When it is time to go, the youth
dips in the milk, and flies off a dove. This goes on every day for
two years. A Greek tale, 'Goldgerte,' Hahn, No 7, I, 97, has the same
transformation, with water for milk. Our <b>B</b> 34 has well-water
only.<a name="FNanchor_1_330" id="FNanchor_1_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> Perhaps the bath of milk occurred in one earlier version
of our ballad, the water-bath in another, and the two accounts became
blended in time.</p>

<p>The end of the mutations, in <b>F</b> 11, <b>G</b> 43, is a naked
man, and a mother-naked man in <b>B</b> 33, under the presumed right
arrangement; meaning by right arrangement, however, not the original
arrangement, but the most consistent one for the actual form of the
tradition. Judging by analogy, the naked man should issue from the
bath of milk or of water; into which he should have gone in one of his
non-human shapes, a dove, swan, or snake (for which, too, a "stand"
of milk or of water is a more practicable bath than for a man). The
fragment <b>C</b> adds some slight probability to this supposition. The
last change there is into "a dove but and a swan;" then Tam Lin bids
the maiden to let go, for he'll "be a perfect man:" this, nevertheless,
he could not well become without some further ceremony. <b>A</b> is the
only version which has preserved an essentially correct process: Tam
Lin, when a burning gleed, is to be thrown into well-water, from which
he will step forth a naked knight.<a name="FNanchor_1_331" id="FNanchor_1_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a></p>

<p>At stated periods, which the ballads make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-339" id="Pg_1-339">[Pg 339]</a></span> to be seven years, the
fiend of hell is entitled to take his teind, tithe, or kane from the
people of fairy-land: <b>A</b> 24, <b>B</b> 23, <b>C</b> 5, <b>D</b>
15, <b>G</b> 28, <b>H</b> 15. The fiend prefers those that are fair
and fu o flesh, according to <b>A</b>, <b>G</b>; ane o flesh and
blood, <b>D</b>. <b>H</b> makes the queen fear for herself; "the koors
they hae gane round about, and I fear it will be mysel." <b>H</b> is
not discordant with popular tradition elsewhere, which attributes
to fairies the practice of abstracting young children to serve as
substitutes for themselves in this tribute: Scott's Minstrelsy, II,
220, 1802. <b>D</b> 15 says "the last here goes to hell," which
would certainly not be equitable, and <b>C</b> "we're a' dung down
to hell," where "all" must be meant only of the naturalized members
of the community. Poor Alison Pearson, who lost her life in 1586 for
believing these things, testified that the tribute was annual. Mr
William Sympson, who had been taken away by the fairies, "bidd her sign
herself that she be not taken away, for the teind of them are tane to
hell everie year:" Scott, as above, p. 208. The kindly queen of the
fairies<a name="FNanchor_1_332" id="FNanchor_1_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> will not allow Thomas of Erceldoune to be exposed to this
peril, and hurries him back to earth the day before the fiend comes
for his due. Thomas is in peculiar danger, for the reason given in
<b>A</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>R</b>.</p>

<p>The elf-queen, <b>A</b> 42, <b>B</b> 40, would have taken out Tam's
twa gray een, had she known he was to be borrowed, and have put in twa
een of tree, <b>B</b> 41, <b>D</b> 34, <b>E</b> 21, <b>H</b> 14; she
would have taken out his heart of flesh, and have put in, <b>B</b>,
<b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, a heart of stane, <b>H</b> of tree. The taking
out of the eyes would probably be to deprive Tam of the faculty of
recognizing fairy folk thereafter. Mortals whose eyes have been touched
with fairies' salve can see them when they are to others invisible,
and such persons, upon distinguishing and saluting fairies, have often
had not simply this power but their ordinary eyesight taken away:
see Cromek's Remains of Nithsdale and Galloway Song, p. 304, Thiele,
Danmarks Folkesagn, 1843, II, 202, <span class="smcap">IV</span>, etc. Grimm has given
instances of witches, Slavic, German, Norse and Italian, taking out the
heart of man (which they are wont to devour), and replacing it in some
instances with straw, wood, or something of the kind; nor do the Roman
witches appear to have been behind later ones in this dealing: Deutsche
Mythologie, 904 f, and the note III, 312.</p>

<p>The fairy in the Lai de Lauval, v. 547, rides on a white palfrey, and
also two damsels, her harbingers, v. 471; so the fairy princess in the
English Launfal, Halliwell, Fairy Mythology, p. 30. The fairy king
and all his knights and ladies ride on white steeds in King Orfeo,
Halliwell, as above, p. 41. The queen of Elfland rides a milk-white
steed in Thomas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-340" id="Pg_1-340">[Pg 340]</a></span> Rymer, <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>; in <b>B</b>, and all copies
of Thomas of Erceldoune, her palfrey is dapple gray. Tam Lin, <b>A</b>
28, <b>B</b> 27, etc., is distinguished from all the rest of his
"court" by being thus mounted; all the other horses are black or brown.</p>

<p>Tam Lane was taken by the fairies, according to <b>G</b> 26, 27, while
sleeping under an apple-tree. In Sir Orfeo (ed. Zielke, v. 68) it was
the queen's sleeping under an ympe-tree that led to her being carried
off by the fairy king, and the ympe-tree we may suppose to be some
kind of fruit tree, if not exclusively the apple. Thomas of Erceldoune
is lying under a semely [derne, cumly] tree, when he sees the fairy
queen. The derivation of that poem from Ogier le Danois shows that this
must have been an apple-tree. Special trees are considered in Greece
dangerous to lie under in summer and at noon, as exposing one to be
taken by the nereids or fairies, especially plane, poplar, fig, nut,
and St John's bread: Schmidt, Volksleben der Neugriechen, p. 119. The
elder and the linden are favorites of the elves in Denmark.</p>

<p>The rencounter at the beginning between Tam Lin and Janet (in the wood,
<b>D</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>) is repeated between Hind Etin [Young
Akin] and Margaret in 'Hind Etin,' further on. Some Slavic ballads open
in a similar way, but there is nothing noteworthy in that: see p. 41.
"First they did call me Jack," etc., <b>D</b> 9, is a commonplace of
frequent occurrence: see, e.g., 'The Knight and Shepherd's Daughter.'</p>

<p>Some humorous verses, excellent in their way, about one Tam o Lin are
very well known: as Tam o the Linn, Chambers, Scottish Songs, p. 455,
Popular Rhymes of Scotland, p. 33, ed. 1870; Sharpe's Ballads, new ed.,
p. 44, p. 137, No XVI; Tommy Linn, North Country Chorister, ed. Ritson,
p. 3; Halliwell's Popular Rhymes and Nursery Tales, p. 271, ed. 1849;
Thomas o Linn, Kinloch MSS, III, 45, V, 81; Tam o Lin, Campbell MSS.,
II, 107. (Miss Joanna Baillie tried her hand at an imitation, but the
jocosity of the real thing is not feminine.) A fool sings this stanza
from such a song in Wager's comedy, 'The longer thou livest, the more
fool thou art,' put at about 1568; see Furnivall, Captain Cox, his
Ballads and Books, p. cxxvii:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">'The deuil go with all!' quoth Tom a Lin.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Mr Halliwell-Phillips (as above) says that "an immense variety of songs
and catches relating to Tommy Linn are known throughout the country."
Brian o Lynn seems to be popular in Ireland: Lover's Legends and
Stories of Ireland, p. 260 f. There is no connection between the song
and the ballad beyond the name: the song is no parody, no burlesque, of
the ballad, as it has been called.</p>

<p>"Carterhaugh is a plain at the confluence of the Ettrick with the
Yarrow, scarcely an English mile above the town of Selkirk, and on this
plain they show two or three rings on the ground, where, they say, the
stands of milk and water stood, and upon which grass never grows."

has remarked, even seems to explain Sophocles calling the nuptials of
Peleus and Thetis "speechless," [Greek: aphthongous gamous]. Sophocles
gives the transformations as being lion, snake, fire, water: Scholia
in Pindari Nemea, III, 60; Schmidt, as before, p. 116, note. That
a firm grip and a fearless one would make any sea-god do your will
would appear from the additional instances of Menelaus and Proteus,
in Odyssey, IV, and of Hercules and Nereus, Apollodorus, II, 5, 11,
4, Scholia in Apollonii Argonaut., IV, 1396. Proteus masks as lion,
snake, panther, boar, running water, tree; Nereus as water, fire, or,
as Apollodorus says, in all sorts of shapes. Bacchus was accustomed to
transform himself when violence was done him, but it is not recorded
that he was ever brought to terms like the watery divinities. See
Mannhardt, Wald- und Feldkulte, II, 60-64, who also well remarks that
the tales of the White Ladies, who, to be released from a ban, must be
kissed three times in various shapes, as toad, wolf, snake, etc., have
relation to these Greek traditions.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_329" id="Footnote_1_329"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_329"><span class="label">[329]</span></a> The significance of the immersion in water is shown by
Mannhardt, Wald-u. Feldkulte, II, 64 ff. The disorder in the stanzas
of <b>A</b> at this place has of course been rectified. In Scott's
version, <b>I</b>, transformations are added at random from <b>C</b>,
<i>after</i> the dipping in milk and in water, which seems indeed to have
been regarded by the reciters only as a measure for cooling red-hot
iron or the burning gleed, and not as the act essential for restoration
to the human nature.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_1_330" id="Footnote_1_330"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_330"><span class="label">[330]</span></a> Possibly the holy water in <b>D</b> 17, <b>G</b> 32, is
a relic of the water-bath.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_331" id="Footnote_1_331"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_331"><span class="label">[331]</span></a> In the MS. of <b>B</b> also the transformation into
a het gad of iron comes just before the direction to dip the object
into a stand of milk; but we have the turning into a mother-naked man
several stanzas earlier. By reading, in 33<sup>1</sup>, I'll turn, and putting 33
after 34, we should have the order of events which we find in <b>A</b>.
</p>
<p>
That Tam Lin should go into water or milk as a dove or snake, or
in some other of his temporary forms, and <i>come out</i> a man, is the
only disposition which is consistent with the order of the world to
which he belongs. Mannhardt gives us a most curious and interesting
insight into some of the laws of that world in Wald-u. Feldkulte,
II, 64-70. The wife of a Cashmere king, in a story there cited from
Benfey's Pantschatantra, I, 254, § 92, is delivered of a serpent, but
is reported to have borne a son. Another king offers his daughter
in marriage, and the Cashmere king, to keep his secret, accepts the
proposal. In due time the princess claims her bridegroom, and they
give her the snake. Though greatly distressed, she accepts her lot,
and takes the snake about to the holy places, at the last of which she
receives a command to put the snake into the water-tank. As soon as
this is done the snake takes the form of a man. A woman's giving birth
to a snake was by no means a rare thing in Karst in the seventeenth
century, and it was the rule in one noble family that all the offspring
should be in serpent form, or at least have a serpent's head; but a
bath in water turned them into human shape. For elves and water nymphs
who have entered into connections with men in the form of women,
bathing in water is equally necessary for resuming their previous
shape, as appears from an ancient version of the story of Melusina:
Gervasius, ed. Liebrecht, p. 4 f, and Vincentius Bellovacensis,
Speculum Naturale, 2, 127 (from Helinaudus), cited by Liebrecht, at p.
66.
</p>
<p>
A lad who had been changed into an ass by a couple of witches recovers
his shape merely by jumping into water and rolling about in it: William
of Malmesbury's Kings of England, c. 10, cited by Vincent of Beauvais,
Speculum Naturale, iii, 109; Düntzer, Liebrecht's Dunlop, p. 538.
Simple illusions of magic, such as clods and wisps made to appear swine
to our eyes, are inevitably dissolved when the unrealities touch water.

THE QUEEN OF ELFAN'S NOURICE</h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Skene MSS, No 8, p. 25. Sharpe's Ballad Book, ed. Laing, p. 169.</p></div>


<p>We see from this pretty fragment, which, after the nature of the best
popular ballad, forces you to chant and will not be read, that a woman
had been carried off, four days after bearing a son, to serve as nurse
in the elf-queen's family. She is promised that she shall be permitted
to return home if she will tend the fairy's bairn till he has got the
use of his legs. We could well have spared stanzas 10-12, which belong
to '<a href="#Ballad_37">Thomas Rymer</a>,' to know a little more of the proper story.</p>

<p>That elves and water-spirits have frequently solicited the help of
mortal women at lying-in time is well known: see Stewart's Popular
Superstitions of the Highlands, p. 104; Grimm, Deutsche Sagen, Nos 41,
49, 68, 69, 304; Müllenhoff, Nos 443, 444; Thiele, Danmarks Folkesagen,
1843, II, 200, Nos 1-4; Asbjørnsen, Norske Huldre-Eventyr, 2d ed.,
I, 16; Maurer, Isländische Volkssagen, p. 6 f; Keightley's Fairy
Mythology, pp 122, 261, 275, 301, 311, 388, 488.<a name="FNanchor_1_333" id="FNanchor_1_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> They also like
to have their offspring suckled by earthly women. It is said, writes
Gervase of Tilbury, that nobody is more exposed to being carried off by
water-sprites than a woman in milk, and that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-359" id="Pg_1-359">[Pg 359]</a></span> sometimes restore
such a woman, with pay for her services, after she has nursed their
wretched fry seven years. He had himself seen a woman who had been
abducted for this purpose, while washing clothes on the bank of the
Rhone. She had to nurse the nix's son under the water for that term,
and then was sent back unhurt. Otia Imperialia, III, 85, Liebrecht, p.
38. Choice is naturally made of the healthiest and handsomest mothers
for this office. "A fine young woman of Nithsdale, when first made
a mother, was sitting singing and rocking her child, when a pretty
lady came into her cottage, covered with a fairy mantle. She carried
a beautiful child in her arms, swaddled in green silk. 'Gie my bonnie
thing a suck,' said the fairy. The young woman, conscious to whom the
child belonged, took it kindly in her arms, and laid it to her breast.
The lady instantly disappeared, saying, 'Nurse kin', an ne'er want.'
The young mother nurtured the two babes, and was astonished, whenever
she awoke, at finding the richest suits of apparel for both children,
with meat of most delicious flavor. This food tasted, says tradition,
like loaf mixed with wine and honey," etc. Cromek, Remains of Nithsdale
and Galloway Song, p. 302.</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to remark that this ballad, like too many
others, has suffered severely by the accidents of tradition. <b>A</b>
has been not simply damaged by passing through low mouths, but has been
worked over by low hands. Something considerable has been lost from
the story, and fine romantic features, preserved in Norse and German
ballads, have been quite effaced.</p>

<p>Margaret, a king's daughter, <b>A</b>, an earl's daughter, <b>B</b>, a
lady of noble birth, <b>C</b>, as she sits sewing in her bower door,
hears a note in Elmond's wood and wishes herself there, <b>A</b>. The
wood is Amon-shaw in <b>C</b>, Mulberry in <b>B</b>: the Elmond (Amond,
Elfman?) is probably significant. So far the heroine resembles Lady
Isabel in No 4, who, sewing in her bower, hears an elf-horn, and cannot
resist the enchanted tone. Margaret makes for the wood as fast as she
can go. The note that is heard in <b>A</b> is mistaken in <b>B</b> for
<i>nuts</i>: Margaret, as she stands in her bower door, spies some nuts
growing in the wood, and wishes herself there. Arrived at the wood,
Margaret, in <b>A</b> as well as <b>B</b>, immediately takes to pulling
nuts.<a name="FNanchor_1_334" id="FNanchor_1_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> The lady is carried off in <b>C</b> under cover of a magical
mist, and the hero in all is no ordinary hind.</p>

<p>Margaret has hardly pulled a nut, when she is confronted by young
Akin, <b>A</b>, otherwise, and correctly, called Etin in <b>B</b>, a
hind of giant strength in both, who accuses her of trespassing, and
stops her. Akin pulls up the highest tree in the wood and builds a
bower, invisible to passers-by, for their habitation. <b>B</b>, which
recognizes no influence of enchantment upon the lady's will, as found
in <b>A</b>, and no prepossession on her part, as in <b>C</b>, makes
Hind Etin pull up the biggest tree in the forest as well, but it is to
scoop out a cave many fathoms deep, in which he confines Margaret till
she comes to terms, and consents to <i>go home</i> with him, wherever that
may be. Hastings, another corruption of Etin, carries off the lady on
his horse to the wood, "where again their loves are sworn," and there
they take up their abode in a cave of stone, <b>C</b> 9. Lady Margaret
lives with the etin seven years, and bears him seven sons, <b>A</b> 9;
many years, and bears seven sons, <b>B</b>; ten years, and bears seven
bairns, <b>C</b> 6, 8, 9.<a name="FNanchor_1_335" id="FNanchor_1_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a></p>

<p>Once upon a time the etin goes hunting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-361" id="Pg_1-361">[Pg 361]</a></span> and takes his eldest boy with
him. The boy asks his father why his mother is so often in tears, and
the father says it is because she was born of high degree, but had been
stolen by him; "is wife of Hynde Etin, wha ne'er got christendame,"
<b>B</b> 15. The etin, who could pull the highest tree in the wood up
by the roots, adds in <b>A</b> 15 that when he stole his wife he was
her father's cup-bearer! and that he caught her "on a misty night,"
which reminds us of the mist which Young Hastings, "the groom," cast
before the lady's attendants when he carried her off.</p>

<p>The next time Akin goes hunting he leaves his young comrade behind,
and the boy tells his mother that he heard "fine music ring" when he
was coming home, on the other occasion. She wishes she had been there.
He takes his mother and six brothers, and they make their way through
the wood at their best speed, not knowing in what direction they are
going. But luckily they come to the gate of the king, the father and
grandfather of the band. The mother sends her eldest boy in with three
rings, to propitiate the porter, the butler-boy, who acts as usher in
this particular palace, and the minstrel who plays before the king. His
majesty is so struck with the resemblance of the boy to his daughter
that he is blinded with tears. The boy informs his grandfather that
his mother is standing at the gates, with six more brothers, and the
king orders that she be admitted. He asks her to dine, but she can
touch nothing till she has seen her mother and sister. Admitted to her
mother, the queen in turn says, You will dine with me; but she can
touch nothing till she has seen her sister. Her sister, again, invites
her to dine, but now she can touch nothing till she has seen her "dear
husband." Rangers are sent into the wood to fetch Young Akin, under
promise of a full pardon. He is found tearing his yellow hair. The
king now asks Akin to dine with him, and there appears to have been
a family dinner. While this is going on the boy expresses a wish to
be christened, "to get christendoun;" in all his eight years he had
never been in a church. The king promises that he shall go that very
day with his mother, and all seven of the boys seem to have got their
christendoun; and so, we may hope, did Hind Etin, who was, if possible,
more in want of it than they; <b>B</b> 15, 19.</p>

<p>In this story <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> pretty nearly agree. <b>C</b> has
nothing of the restoration of the lady to her parents and home. The
mother, in this version, having harped her seven bairns asleep, sits
down and weeps bitterly. She wishes, like Fair Annie, that they were
rats, and she a cat, to eat them one and all. She has lived ten years
in a stone cave, and has never had a churching. The eldest boy suggests
that they shall all go to some church: they be christened and she be
churched. This is accomplished without any difficulty, and, as the tale
stands, we can only wonder that it had not been attempted before.</p>

<p>The etin of the Scottish story is in Norse and German a dwarf-king,
elf-king, hill-king, or even a merman. The ballad is still sung in
Scandinavia and Germany, but only the Danes have versions taken down
before the present century.</p>

<p><b>Icelandic.</b> 'Rika álfs kvæði,' Íslenzk fornkvæði, No 4.</p>

<p>Danish <b>A</b>, one of the three sixteenth-century versions, tells how
a knight, expressing a strong desire to obtain a king's daughter, is
overheard by a dwarf, who says this shall never be. The dwarf pretends
to bargain with the knight for his services in forwarding the knight's
object, but consults meanwhile with his mother how he may get the lady
for himself.<a name="FNanchor_1_338" id="FNanchor_1_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> The mother tells him that the princess will go to
even-song, and the dwarf writes runes on the way she must go by, which
compel her to come to the hill. The dwarf holds out his hand and asks,
How came ye to this strange land? to which the lady answers mournfully,
I wot never how. The dwarf says, You have pledged yourself to a knight,
and he has betrayed you with runes: this eve you shall be the dwarf's
guest. She stayed there the night, and was taken back to her mother in
the morning. Eight years went by; her hand was sought by five kings,
nine counts, but no one of them could get a good answer. One day her
mother asked, Why are thy cheeks so faded? Why can no one get thee? She
then revealed that she had been beguiled by the dwarf, and had seven
sons and a daughter in the hill, none of whom she ever saw. She thought
she was alone, but the dwarf-king was listening. He strikes her with an
elf-rod, and bids her hie to the hill after him. Late in the evening
the poor thing dons her cloak, knocks at her father's door, and says
good-night to the friends that never will see her again, then sadly
turns to the hill. Her seven sons advance to meet her, and ask why she
told of their father. Her tears run sore; she gives no answer; she is
dead ere midnight.</p>

<p>With <b>A</b> agrees another of the three old Danish copies, <b>B</b>,
and three modern ones, <b>D</b>, <b>M</b>, <b>N</b>, have something
of the opening scene which characterizes <b>A</b>. So also Swedish
<b>C</b>, <b>I</b>, and the Icelandic ballad. In Swedish <b>C</b>,
Proud Margaret, who is daughter of a king of seven kingdoms, will have
none of her suitors (this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-363" id="Pg_1-363">[Pg 363]</a></span> circumstance comes too soon). A hill-king
asks his mother how he may get her. She asks in return, What will you
give me to make her come of herself to the hill? He promises red gold
and chestfuls of pence; and one Sunday morning Margaret, who has set
out to go to church, is made&mdash;by magical operations, of course&mdash;to take
the way to the hill.</p>

<p>A second form begins a stage later: Danish <b>C</b>, <b>G</b>,
<b>K</b>, Swedish <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>K</b>, Norwegian <b>A</b>,
<b>C</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>I</b> (?), <b>K</b>,
<b>L</b>, <b>M</b> (?), <b>N</b> (?), Färöe <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>. We
learn nothing of the device by which the maid has been entrapped.
Mother and daughter are sitting in their bower, and the mother asks
her child why her cheeks are pale, why milk is running from her
breasts. She answers that she has been working too hard; that what is
taken for milk is mead. The mother retorts that other women do not
suffer from their industry; that mead is brown, and milk is white.
Hereupon the daughter reveals that she has been beguiled by an elf,
and, though living under her mother's roof, has had eight or nine
children (seven or eight sons and a daughter; fifteen children, Färöe
<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>), none of whom she ever saw, since after birth they
were always transferred to the hill (see, especially, Danish <b>C</b>,
<b>G</b>, also <b>A</b>; Norwegian <b>H</b>, <b>I</b>; Färöe <b>A</b>,
<b>B</b>). The mother (who disowns her, Danish <b>C</b>, <b>G</b>,
Swedish <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, Norwegian <b>K</b>), in several versions,
asks what gifts she got for her honor. Among these was a harp [horn,
Norwegian <b>L</b>], which she was to play when she was unhappy.
The mother asks for a piece, and the first tones bring the elf, who
reproaches the daughter for betraying him: had she concealed their
connection she might still have lived at home, <b>C</b>; but now she
must go with him. She is kindly received by her children. They give her
a drink which makes her forget father and mother, heaven and earth,
moon and sun, and even makes her think she was born in the hill, Danish
<b>C</b>, <b>G</b>, Swedish <b>D</b>, Norwegian <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>.<a name="FNanchor_1_339" id="FNanchor_1_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a></p>

<p>Danish <b>G</b>, <b>K</b>, Färöe <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, take a tragic
turn: the woman dies in the first two the night she comes to the hill.
Danish <b>C</b>, one of the sixteenth-century versions, goes as far as
possible in the other direction. The elf-king pats Maldfred's cheek,
takes her in his arms, gives her a queen's crown and name.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And this he did for the lily-wand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had himself christened and all his land!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A third series of versions offers the probable type of the
much-corrupted Scottish ballads, and under this head come Danish
<b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>L-R</b>, <b>T</b>;
Swedish <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>F-I</b>, and also <b>C</b>, after an
introduction which belongs to the first class; Norwegian <b>D</b>,
<b>F</b>. The characteristic feature is that the woman has been living
eight or nine years in the hill, and has there borne her children,
commonly seven sons and a daughter. She sets out to go to matins, and
whether under the influence of runes, or accidentally, or purposely,
takes the way to the hill. In a few cases it is clear that she does not
seek the hill-man or put herself in his way, e.g., Danish <b>N</b>,
Swedish <b>G</b>, but Swedish <b>A</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>N</b> make her
apply for admission at the hill-door. In Danish <b>I</b>, <b>N-R</b>,
<b>T</b>, Norwegian <b>F</b>, it is not said that she was on her way
to church; she is in a field or in the hill. In Swedish <b>F</b> she
has been two years in the cave, and it seems to her as if she had
come yesterday. After her eight or nine years with the hill-man the
woman longs to go home, Danish <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>I</b>, Swedish
<b>A</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>I</b>, Norwegian <b>D</b>; to go to church,
Danish <b>L</b>, <b>M</b>, <b>N</b>, <b>P</b>, <b>T</b>, Norwegian
<b>F</b>; for she had heard Denmark's bells, church bells, Danish
<b>L-P</b>, <b>T</b>, Swedish <b>G</b>, Norwegian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-364" id="Pg_1-364">[Pg 364]</a></span> <b>D</b>, <b>F</b>.
She had heard these bells as she watched the cradle, Danish <b>T</b>,
<b>P</b>, Swedish <b>G</b>; sat by the cradle and sang, <b>T</b> 4;
compare English <b>C</b> 7. She asks the hill-man's permission, and it
is granted on certain terms: she is not to talk of him and her life
in the hill, Danish <b>E</b>, <b>I</b>, Swedish <b>A</b>, <b>F</b>,
<b>I</b>, is to come back, Danish <b>F</b>, must not stay longer than
an hour or two, Norwegian <b>D</b>; she is not to wear her gold, her
best clothes, not to let out her hair, not to go into her mother's pew
at the church, not to bow when the priest pronounces the holy name,
or make an offering, or go home after service, etc., Danish <b>I</b>,
<b>L-P</b>, <b>T</b>, Norwegian <b>F</b>. All these last conditions she
violates, nor does she in the least heed the injunction not to speak of
the hill-man. The consequence is that he summarily presents himself,
whether at the church or the paternal mansion, and orders her back to
the hill, sometimes striking her on the ear or cheek so that blood
runs, or beating her with a rod, Danish <b>E</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>L</b>,
<b>M</b>, <b>S</b>, <b>T</b>, Swedish <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>,
<b>H</b>, <b>I</b>, Norwegian <b>F</b>. In a few versions, the hill-man
tells her that her children are crying for her, and she replies, Let
them cry; I will never go back to the hill; Danish <b>M</b>, <b>N</b>,
<b>O</b>, Norwegian <b>F</b>. In Danish <b>E</b>, Swedish <b>G</b>,
a gold apple thrown into her lap seems to compel her to return; more
commonly main force is used. She is carried dead into the hill, or dies
immediately on her arrival, in Norwegian <b>F</b>, Danish <b>T</b>; she
dies of grief, according to traditional comment, in Norwegian <b>D</b>.
They give her a drink, and her heart breaks, Swedish <b>A</b>,
<b>G</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>M</b>; but elsewhere the drink only induces
forgetfulness, Danish <b>L</b>, <b>M</b>, Swedish <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>,
<b>F</b>.</p>

<p>Much of the story of 'Jomfruen og Dværgekongen' recurs in the ballad
of 'Agnete og Havmanden,' which, for our purposes, may be treated as a
simple variation of the other. The Norse forms are again numerous, but
all from broadsides dating, at most, a century back, or from recent
tradition.</p>

<p><b>Danish.</b> 'Agnete og Havmanden,' Grundtvig, No 38, <b>A-D</b>, II,
51 ff, 656 ff, III, 813 ff. Copies of <b>A</b> are numerous, and two
had been previously printed; in Danske Viser, I, 313, No 50, and "in
Barfod's Brage og Idun, II, 264." <b>E</b>, Rask's Morskabslæsning,

<p><b>Norwegian.</b> <b>A</b>, Grundtvig, III, 817, properly Danish
rather than Norwegian. <b>B</b>, a version partly described at p. 818.
<b>C</b>, Grundtvig, IV, 809, also more Danish than Norwegian. All
these communicated by Bugge.</p>

<p>Danish <b>C</b>, <b>G</b>, Norwegian <b>A</b>, have a hillman instead
of a merman, and might as well have been put with the other ballad.
On the other hand, the Danish versions <b>M</b>, <b>N</b>, <b>O</b>
of 'The Maid and the Dwarf-King' call the maid Agenet, and give the
hill-man a name, Nek, Netmand, Mekmand, which implies a watery origin
for him, and the fragments <b>P</b>, <b>Q</b>, <b>R</b> have similar
names, Nekmand, Negen, Lækkemand, as also Agenete, and might as well
have been ranked with 'Agnes and the Merman.' In 'The Maid and the
Dwarf-King,' Swedish <b>L</b> (one stanza) the maid is taken by "Pel
Elfven" to the sea.</p>

<p>Agnes goes willingly with the merman to the sea-bottom, Danish
<b>A</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>K</b>, Swedish <b>A</b>, <b>D</b>,
<b>E</b>, Norwegian <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>. She lives there, according
to many versions, eight years, and has seven children. As she is
sitting and singing by the cradle one day, she hears the bells of
England, Danish <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>H</b>,
<b>I</b>, <b>K</b>, Swedish <b>D</b> [church bells, bells, <b>F</b>,
<b>G</b>], Norwegian <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>. She asks if she may go to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-365" id="Pg_1-365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
church, go home, and receives permission on the same terms as in the
other ballad. Her mother asks her what gifts she had received, Danish
<b>A</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>I</b>, Swedish <b>E</b>,
<b>F</b>, Norwegian <b>C</b>. When the merman comes into the church
all the images turn their backs, Danish <b>A</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>K</b>,
Swedish <b>D</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>, Norwegian <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>;
and, in some cases, for Agnes, too. He tells her that the children are
crying for her; she refuses to go back, Danish <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>,<b>
D</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>K</b>, Swedish <b>D</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>
(and apparently <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>), Norwegian <b>C</b>.
In Norwegian <b>A</b> the merman strikes her on the cheek, and she
returns; in Danish <b>I</b> she is taken back quietly; in Danish
<b>C</b> he gives her so sore an ail that she dies presently; in Danish
<b>H</b> she is taken away by force, and poisoned by her children; in
Danish <b>K</b> the merman says that if she stays with her mother they
must divide the children (five). He takes two, she two, and each has to
take half of the odd one.</p>

<p>The Norse forms of 'Agnes and the Merman' are conceded to have been
derived from Germany: see Grundtvig, IV, 812. Of the <b>German</b>
ballad, which is somewhat nearer to the English, the following versions
have been noted:</p>

<p><b>A.</b> 'Die schöne Agniese,' Fiedler, Volksreime und Volkslieder
in Anhalt-Dessau, p. 140, No 1 == Mittler, No 553. <b>B.</b> 'Die
schöne Agnese,' Parisius, Deutsche Volkslieder in der Altmark und
im Magdeburgischen gesammelt, p. 29, No 8 B, from nearly the same
region as <b>A</b>. <b>C.</b> Parisius, p. 28, No 8 A, Pechau on the
Elbe. <b>D.</b> 'Die schöne Angnina,' Erk's Neue Sammlung, ii, 40, No

IV, 91, from the neighborhood of Guben. <i>F.</i> 'Die schöne Dorothea,'
Liederhort, No 16<sup>b</sup>, p. 48, Gramzow in der Ukermark. <b>G.</b> 'Die
schöne Hann&#259;le,' Liederhort, No 16, p. 44, Erk's Wunderhorn, IV,

Schlesische Volkslieder, p. 3, No 1 == Mittler, No 551, Böhme, No 90 A,
Breslau. 'Der Wassermann,' Simrock, No 1, is a compounded copy.</p>

<p>A wild merman has become enamored of the King of England's daughter,
<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>. He plates a bridge with gold;
she often walks over the bridge; it sinks with her into the water
[the merman drags her down into the water, <b>H</b>]. She stays below
seven years, and bears seven sons. One day [by the cradle, <b>C</b>,
<b>G</b>] she hears the bells of England, <b>A</b> 6, <b>B</b>,
<b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>F</b> [bells, <b>E</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>], and
longs to go to church. She expresses this wish to the merman, <b>C</b>,
<b>D</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>. The merman says she must take her seven
sons with her, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>; she must come back,
<b>G</b>, <b>H</b>. She takes her seven sons by the hand, and goes
with them to England, <b>A</b> 5, <b>B</b> 7; cf. Scottish <b>C</b>
13, 14, <b>A</b> 22, 50. When she enters the church everything in it
bows, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>F</b>. Her parents are there, <b>C</b>,
<b>D</b>; her father opens the pew, her mother lays a cushion for her,
<b>G</b>, <b>H</b>. As she goes out of the church, there stands the
merman, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>. Her parents take her
home in <b>D</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>. They seat her at the table, and
while she is eating, a gold apple falls into her lap (cf. 'The Maid and
the Dwarf-King,' Danish <b>E</b>, Swedish <b>G</b>), which she begs
her mother to throw into the fire; the merman appears, and asks if she
wishes him burnt, <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>. The merman, when he presents
himself at the church, asks whether the woman will go back with him,
or die where she is, and she prefers death on the spot, <b>A</b>,
<b>B</b>, <b>E</b>. In the other case, he says that if she will not
return, the children must be divided,&mdash;three and three, and half of the
seventh to each; the mother prefers the water to this. <b>D</b> has a
peculiar and not very happy trait. The merman fastens a chain to his
wife's foot before she goes up, and, having been kept long waiting,
draws it in. But the people at the church have taken off the chain, and
he finds nothing at the end of it. He asks whether she does not wish
to live with him; she replies, I will no longer torment you, or fret
myself to death.</p>

<p>The story of Agnes and the Merman occurs in a Wendish ballad, with an
introductory scene found in the beautiful German ballad, 'Wassermanns
Braut:'<a name="FNanchor_1_341" id="FNanchor_1_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> Haupt und Schma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-366" id="Pg_1-366">[Pg 366]</a></span>ler, I, 62, No 34. A maid begs that she
may be left to herself for a year, but her father says it is time for
her to be married. She goes to her chamber, weeps and wrings her hands.
The merman comes and asks, Where is my bride? They tell him that she
is in her chamber, weeping and wringing her hands. The merman asks her
the reason, and she answers, They all say that you are the merwoman's
son. He says he will build her a bridge of pure silver and gold, and
have her driven over it with thirty carriages and forty horses; but
ere she has half passed the bridge it goes down to the bottom. She is
seven years below, has seven sons in as many years, and is going with
the eighth. She implores her husband to permit her to go to church in
the upper world, and he consents, with the proviso that she shall not
stay for the benediction. At church she sees her brother and sister,
who receive her kindly. She tells them that she cannot stay till the
benediction;<a name="FNanchor_1_342" id="FNanchor_1_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> they beg her to come home to dine with them. She does
wait till the benediction; the merman rushes frantically about. As she
leaves the church and is saying good-by to her sister, she meets the
merman, who snatches the youngest child from her (she appears to have
all seven with her), tears it in pieces, strangles the rest, scatters
their limbs on the road, and hangs himself, asking, Does not your
heart grieve for your children? She answers, I grieve for none but the
youngest.<a name="FNanchor_1_343" id="FNanchor_1_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a></p>

<p>A Slovenian ballad has the story with modifications, Achacel and
Korytko, [S,]lovén&#351;ke Pé&#351;mi krajnskiga Naróda, I, 30,<a name="FNanchor_1_344" id="FNanchor_1_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a>
'Povodnji mósh;' given in abstract by Haupt and Schmaler, I, 339, note
to No. 34. Mizika goes to a dance, in spite of her mother's forbidding.
Her mother, in a rage, wishes that the merman may fetch her. A young
man who dances with her whirls her round so furiously that she
complains, but he becomes still more violent. Mizika sees how it is,
and exclaims, The merman has come for me! The merman flies out of the
window with her, and plunges into the water. She bears a son, and asks
leave to pay a visit to her mother; and this is allowed on conditions,
one of which is that she shall not expose herself to a benediction. She
does not conform, and the merman comes and says that her son is crying
for her. She refuses to go with him, and he tears the boy in two, that
each may have a half.</p>

<p>Two or three of the minuter correspondences between the Scottish and
the Norse or German ballads, which have not been referred to, may be
indicated in conclusion. The hillman, in several Norwegian copies, as
<b>B</b>, <b>M</b>, carries off the lady on horseback, and so Hastings
in <b>C</b>. In <b>A</b> 34-39, the returned sister, being invited
to dine, cannot eat a bit or drink a drop. So, in 'The Maid and the
Dwarf-King,' Swedish <b>G</b> 15, 16, they set before Agnes dishes four
and five, dishes eight and nine, but she can take nothing:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Agneta ej smakte en endaste bit.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Young Akin, in <b>A</b> 43, is found in the wood, "tearing his yellow
hair." The merman has golden hair in Danish <b>A</b> 16, Swedish
<b>D</b> 2, 19, Norwegian <b>A</b> 17 (nothing very remarkable,
certainly), and in Danish <b>D</b> 31 wrings his hands and is very
unhappy, because Agnes refuses to return. It is much more important
that in one of the Swedish copies of the merman ballad, Grundtvig, II,
661a, we find a trace of the 'christendom' which is made such an object
in the Scottish ballads:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">And christened her with water and with wine.<br /></span>

<p><a name="Footnote_1_334" id="Footnote_1_334"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_334"><span class="label">[334]</span></a> This reading, <i>nuts</i>, may have subsequently made its way
into <b>A</b> instead of <i>rose</i>, which it would be more ballad-like for
Margaret to be plucking, as the maid does in 'Tam Lin,' where also the
passage <b>A</b> 3-6, <b>B</b> 2-4 occurs. Grimm suggests a parallel
to Tam Lin in the dwarf Laurin, who does not allow trespassing in
his rose-garden: Deutsche Mythologie, III, 130. But the resemblance
seems not material, there being no woman in the case. The pretence of
trespass in Tam Lin and Hind Etin is a simple commonplace, and we have
it in some Slavic forms of No 4, as at p. 41.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_335" id="Footnote_1_335"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_335"><span class="label">[335]</span></a> <b>B</b> is defective in the middle and the end. "The
reciter, unfortunately, could not remember more of the ballad, although
the story was strongly impressed on her memory. She related that the
lady, after having been taken home by Hynde Etin, lived with him many
years, and bore him seven sons, the eldest of whom, after the inquiries
at his parents detailed in the ballad, determines to go in search of
the earl, his grandfather. At his departure his mother instructs him
how to proceed, giving him a ring to bribe the porter at her father's
gate, and a silken vest, wrought by her own hand, to be worn in
presence of her father. The son sets out, and arrives at the castle,
where, by bribing the porter, he gets admission to the earl, who,
struck with the resemblance of the youth to his lost daughter, and the
similarity of the vest to one she had wrought for himself, examines the
young man, from whom he discovers the fate of his daughter. He gladly
receives his grandson, and goes to his daughter's residence, where he
meets her and Hynde Etin, who is pardoned by the earl, through the
intercession of his daughter." Kinloch, Ancient Scottish Ballads, p.
226 f.</p></div>

occurs frequently in tradition, as might be expected. In a Swedish
merman-ballad, 'Necken,' Afzelius, III, 133, the nix, who has attended
to church the lady whom he is about to kidnap, makes off with his best
speed when the priest reads the benediction. See, further, Árnason's

CLERK COLVILL</h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><b><a href="#Version_42_A">A</a>.</b> 'Clark Colven,' from a transcript of No 13 of William
Tytler's Brown MS.</p>

<p><b><a href="#Version_42_B">B</a>.</b> 'Clerk Colvill, or, The Mermaid,' Herd's Ancient and
Modern Scots Songs, 1769, p. 302.</p>

<p><b><a href="#Version_42_C">C</a>.</b> W. F. in Notes and Queries, Fourth Series, VIII, 510,
from the recitation of a lady in Forfarshire.</p></div>


<p>Although, as has been already said, William Tytler's Brown manuscript
is now not to be found, a copy of two of its fifteen ballads has
been preserved in the Fraser Tytler family,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-372" id="Pg_1-372">[Pg 372]</a></span> and 'Clerk Colvill,'
<b>A</b> ('Clark Colven') is one of the two.<a name="FNanchor_1_345" id="FNanchor_1_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> This ballad is not
in Jamieson's Brown manuscript. Rewritten by Lewis, <b>A</b> was
published in Tales of Wonder, 1801, II, 445, No 56. <b>B</b>, 1769, is
the earliest printed English copy, but a corresponding Danish ballad
antedates its publication by seventy-five years. Of <b>C</b>, W. F.,
who communicated it to Notes and Queries, says: "I have reason to
believe that it is originally from the same source as that from which
Scott, and especially Jamieson, derived many of their best ballads."
This source should be no other than Mrs Brown, who certainly may have
known two versions of Clerk Colvill; but <b>C</b> is markedly different
from <b>A</b>. An Abbotsford manuscript, entitled "Scottish Songs,"
has, at fol. 3, a version which appears to have been made up from
Lewis's copy, its original, <b>A</b>, and Herd's, <b>B</b>.</p>

<p>All the English versions are deplorably imperfect, and <b>C</b>
is corrupted, besides. The story which they afford is this. Clerk
Colvill, newly married as we may infer, is solemnly entreated by his
gay lady never to go near a well-fared may who haunts a certain spring
or water. It is clear that before his marriage he had been in the
habit of resorting to this mermaid, as she is afterwards called, and
equally clear, from the impatient answer which he renders his dame,
that he means to visit her again. His coming is hailed with pleasure
by the mermaid, who, in the course of their interview, does something
which gives him a strange pain in the head,&mdash;a pain only increased
by a prescription which she pretends will cure it, and, as she then
exultingly tells him, sure to grow worse until he is dead. He draws his
sword on her, but she merrily springs into the water. He mounts his
horse, rides home tristful, alights heavily, and bids his mother make
his bed, for all is over with him.</p>

<p><b>C</b> is at the beginning blended with verses which belong to
'Willie and May Margaret,' Jamieson, I, 135 (from Mrs Brown's
recitation), or 'The Drowned Lovers,' Buchan, I, 140. In this ballad a
mother adjures her son not to go wooing, under pain of her curse. He
goes, nevertheless, and is drowned. It is obvious, without remark, that
the band and belt in <b>C</b> 1 do not suit the mother; neither does
the phrase 'love Colin' in the second stanza.<a name="FNanchor_1_346" id="FNanchor_1_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> <b>C</b> 9-11 afford
an important variation from the other versions. The mermaid appears at
the foot of the young man's bed, and offers him a choice between dying
then and living with her in the water. (See the Norwegian ballads at p.
377.)</p>

<p>Clerk Colvill is not, as his representative is or may be in other
ballads, the guiltless and guileless object of the love or envy of a
water-sprite or elf. His relations with the mermaid began before his
marriage with his gay lady, and his death is the natural penalty of
his desertion of the water-nymph; for no point is better established
than the fatal consequences of inconstancy in such connections.<a name="FNanchor_1_347" id="FNanchor_1_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a>
His history, were it fully told, would closely resemble that of the
Knight of Staufenberg, as narrated in a German poem of about the year
1300.<a name="FNanchor_1_348" id="FNanchor_1_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a></p>

<p>The already very distinguished chevalier, Peter Diemringer, of
Staufenberg (in the Or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-373" id="Pg_1-373">[Pg 373]</a></span>tenau, Baden, four leagues from Strassburg),
when riding to mass one Whitsunday, saw a lady of surpassing beauty,
dressed with equal magnificence, sitting on a rock by the wayside.
He became instantaneously enamored, and, greeting the lady in terms
expressive of his admiration, received no discouraging reply. The lady
rose; the knight sprang from his horse, took a hand which she offered,
helped her from the rock, and they sat down on the grass. The knight
asked how she came to be there alone. The lady replied that she had
been waiting for him: ever since he could bestride a horse she had been
devoted to him; she had been his help and protection in tourneys and
fights, in all climes and regions, though he had never seen her. The
knight wished he might ever be hers. He could have his wish, she said,
and never know trouble or sickness, on one condition, and that was that
he never should marry: if he did this, he would die in three days. He
vowed to be hers as long as he lived; they exchanged kisses, and then
she bade him mount his horse and go to mass. After the benediction he
was to return home, and when he was alone in his chamber, and wished
for her, she would come, and so always; that privilege God had given
her: "swâ ich wil, dâ bin ich." They had their meeting when he returned
from church: he redoubled his vows, she promised him all good things,
and the bounties which he received from her overflowed upon all his
friends and comrades.</p>

<p>The knight now undertook a chivalrous tour, to see such parts of the
world as he had not visited before. Wherever he went, the fair lady
had only to be wished for and she was by him: there was no bound to
her love or her gifts. Upon his return he was beset by relatives and
friends, and urged to marry. He put them off with excuses: he was too
young to sacrifice his freedom, and what not. They returned to the
charge before long, and set a wise man of his kindred at him to beg a
boon of him. "Anything," he said, "but marrying: rather cut me into
strips than that." Having silenced his advisers by this reply, he went
to his closet and wished for his lady. She was full of sympathy, and
thought it might make his position a little easier if he should tell
his officious friends something of the real case, how he had a wife who
attended him wherever he went and was the source of all his prosperity;
but he must not let them persuade him, or what she had predicted would
surely come to pass.</p>

<p>At this time a king was to be chosen at Frankfurt, and all the nobility
flocked thither, and among them Staufenberg, with a splendid train.
He, as usual, was first in all tourneys, and made himself remarked
for his liberal gifts and his generous consideration of youthful
antagonists: his praise was in everybody's mouth. The king sent for
him, and offered him an orphan niece of eighteen, with a rich dowry.
The knight excused himself as unworthy of such a match. The king said
his niece must accept such a husband as he pleased to give, and many
swore that Staufenberg was a fool. Bishops, who were there in plenty,
asked him if he had a wife already. Staufenberg availed himself of the
leave which had been given him, and told his whole story, not omitting
that he was sure to die in three days if he married. "Let me see the
woman," said one of the bishops. "She lets nobody see her but me,"
answered Staufenberg. "Then it is a devil," said another of the clergy,
"and your soul is lost forever." Staufenberg yielded, and said he would
do the king's will. He was betrothed that very hour, and set out for
Ortenau, where he had appointed the celebration of the nuptials. When
night came he wished for the invisible lady. She appeared, and told him
with all gentleness that he must prepare for the fate of which she had
forewarned him, a fate seemingly inevitable, and not the consequence
of her resentment. At the wedding feast she would display her foot in
sight of all the guests: when he saw that, let him send for the priest.
The knight thought of what the clergy had said, and that this might be
a cheat of the devil. The bride was brought to Staufenberg, the feast
was held, but at the very beginning of it a foot whiter than ivory was
seen through the ceiling. Staufenberg tore his hair and cried, Friends,
ye have ruined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-374" id="Pg_1-374">[Pg 374]</a></span> yourselves and me! He begged his bride and all who had
come with her to the wedding to stay for his funeral, ordered a bed to
be prepared for him and a priest to be sent for. He asked his brothers
to give his bride all that he had promised her. But she said no; his
friends should rather have all that she had brought; she would have no
other husband, and since she had been the cause of his death she would
go into a cloister, where no eye should see her: which she did after
she had returned to her own country.</p>

<p>A superscription to the old poem denominates Staufenberg's amphibious
consort a mer-fey, sea-fairy; but that description is not to be
strictly interpreted, no more than mer-fey, or fata morgana, is in some
other romantic tales. There is nothing of the water-sprite in her, nor
is she spoken of by any such name in the poem itself. The local legends
of sixty years ago,<a name="FNanchor_1_349" id="FNanchor_1_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> and perhaps still, make her to have been a
proper water-nymph. She is first met with by the young knight near a
spring or a brook, and it is in a piece of water that he finds his
death, and that on the evening of his wedding day.</p>

<p>Clerk Colvill and the mermaid are represented by Sir Oluf and an elf
in Scandinavian ballads to the number of about seventy. The oldest
of these is derived from a Danish manuscript of 1550, two centuries
and a half later than the Staufenberg poem, but two earlier than
Clerk Colvill, the oldest ballad outside of the Scandinavian series.
Five other versions are of the date 1700, or earlier, the rest from
tradition of this century. No ballad has received more attention
from the heroic Danish editor, whose study of 'Elveskud' presents an
admirably ordered synoptic view of all the versions known up to 1881:

<p>Of these the Färöe versions are nearest to the English. Olaf's mother
asks him whither he means to ride; his corselet is hanging in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-375" id="Pg_1-375">[Pg 375]</a></span> the
loft; <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>. "I am going to the heath, to course
the hind," he says. "You are not going to course the hind; you are
going to your leman. White is your shirt, well is it washed, but bloody
shall it be when it is taken off," <b>A</b>, <b>D</b>. "God grant it
be not as she bodes!" exclaims Olaf, as he turns from his mother,
<b>A</b>. He rides to the hills and comes to an elf-house. An elf comes
out, braiding her hair, and invites him to dance. "You need not braid
your hair for me; I have not come a-wooing," he says. "I must quit the
company of elves, for to-morrow is my bridal." "If you will have no
more to do with elves, a sick bridegroom shall you be! Would you rather
lie seven years in a sick-bed, or go to the mould to-morrow?" He would
rather go to the mould to-morrow. The elf brought him a drink, with an
atter-corn, a poison grain, floating in it: at the first draught his
belt burst <b>A</b>, <b>B*</b>. "Kiss me," she said, "before you ride."
He leaned over and kissed her, though little mind had he to it: she was
beguiling him, him so sick a man. His mother came out to meet him: "Why
are you so pale, as if you had been in an elf-dance?" "I have been in
an elf-dance," he said,<a name="FNanchor_1_352" id="FNanchor_1_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> went to bed, turned his face to the wall,
and was dead before midnight. His mother and his love (moy, vív) died
thereupon.</p>

<p>Distinct evidence of previous converse with elves is lacking in the
Icelandic versions. Olaf rides along the cliffs, and comes upon an
elf-house. One elf comes out with her hair twined with gold, another
with a silver tankard, a third in a silver belt, and a fourth welcomes
him by name. "Come into the booth and drink with us." "I will not live
with elves," says Olaf; "rather will I believe in God." The elf answers
that he might do both, excuses herself for a moment, and comes back in
a cloak, which hides a sword. "You shall not go without giving us a
kiss," she says. Olaf leans over his saddle-bow and kisses her, with
but half a heart, and she thrusts the sword under his shoulder-blade
into the roots of his heart. He sees his heart's blood under his
horse's feet, and spurs home to his mother. "Whence comest thou, my
son, and why so pale, as if thou hadst been in an elf-dance (leik)?"
"It boots not to hide it from thee: an elf has beguiled me. Make my
bed, mother; bandage my side, sister." He dies presently: there was
more mourning than mirth; three were borne to the grave together.</p>

<p>Nearly all the Danish and Swedish versions, and a good number of the
Norwegian, interpose an affecting scene between the death of the hero
and that of his bride and his mother. The bride, on her way to Olaf's
house, and on her arrival, is disconcerted and alarmed by several
ominous proceedings or circumstances. She hears bells tolling; sees
people weeping; sees men come and go, but not the bridegroom. She is
put off for a time with false explanations, but in the end discovers
the awful fact. Such a passage occurs in the oldest Danish copy, which
is also the oldest known copy of the ballad. The importance of this
version is such that the story requires to be given with some detail.</p>

<p>Oluf rode out before dawn, but it seemed to him bright as day.<a name="FNanchor_1_353" id="FNanchor_1_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> He
rode to a hill where dwarfs were dancing. A maid stepped out from the
dance, put her arm round his neck, and asked him whither he would ride.
"To talk with my true-love," said he. "But first," said she, "you must
dance with us." She then went on to make him great offers if he would
plight himself to her: a horse that would go to Rome and back in an
hour, and a gold saddle for it; a new corselet, having which he never
need fly from man; a sword such, as never was used in war. Such were
all her benches as if gold were laid in links, and such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-376" id="Pg_1-376">[Pg 376]</a></span> were all her
drawbridges as the gold on his hands. "Keep your gold," he answered; "I
will go home to my true-love." She struck him on the cheek, so that the
blood spattered his coat; she struck him midshoulders, so that he fell
to the ground: "Stand up, Oluf, and ride home; you shall not live more
than a day." He turned his horse, and rode home a shattered man. His
mother was at the gate: "Why comest thou home so sad?" "Dear mother,
take my horse; dear brother, fetch a priest," "Say not so, Oluf; many a
sick man does not die. To whom do you give your betrothed?" "Rise, my
seven brothers, and ride to meet my young bride."</p>

<p>As the bride's train came near the town, they heard the bells going.
"Why is this?" she asked, her heart already heavy with pain; "I know
of no one having been sick." They told her it was a custom there to
receive a bride so. But when she entered the house, all the women were
weeping. "Why are these ladies weeping?" No one durst answer a word.
The bride went on into the hall, and took her place on the bride-bench.
"I see," she said, "knights go and come, but I see not my lord Oluf."
The mother answered, Oluf is gone to the wood with hawk and hound.
"Does he care more for hawk and hound than for his young bride?"</p>

<p>At evening they lighted the torches as if to conduct the bride to the
bride-bed; but Oluf's page, who followed his lady, revealed the truth
on the way. "My lord," he said, "lies on his bier above, and you are to
give your troth to his brother." "Never shalt thou see that day that I
shall give my troth to two brothers." She begged the ladies that she
might see the dead. They opened the door; she ran to the bier, threw
back the cloth, kissed the body precipitately; her heart broke in
pieces; grievous was it to see.</p>

<p>Danish <b>B</b>, printed by Syv in 1695, is the copy by which the
ballad of the Elf-shot has become so extensively known since Herder's
time, through his translation and others.<a name="FNanchor_1_354" id="FNanchor_1_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a></p>

<p>The principal variations of the Scandinavian ballads, so far as they
have not been given, now remain to be noted.</p>

<p>The hero's name is mostly Oluf, Ole, or a modification of this, Wolle,
Rolig, Volder; sometimes with an appendage, as Färöe Ólavur Riddararós,
Rósinkrans, Icelandic Ólafur Liljurós, Norwegian Olaf Liljukrans, etc.
It is Peder in Danish <b>H</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>O</b>, <b>P</b>, <b>Q</b>,
<b>R</b>, <b>Æ</b>.</p>

<p>Excepting the Färöe ballads, Oluf is not distinctly represented as
having had previous acquaintance with the elves. In Swedish <b>A</b>
5 he says, I cannot dance with you, my betrothed has forbidden me; in
Danish <b>C</b>, I should be very glad if I could; to-morrow is my
wedding-day.</p>

<p>The object of his riding out is to hunt, or the like, in Danish <b>D
b</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>R</b>, <b>T</b>, <b>X</b>,
<b>Y</b>; to bid guests to his wedding, Danish <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D
a</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>K-N</b>, <b>P</b>, <b>S</b>, <b>U</b>,
<b>V</b>, <b>Ø</b>, Norwegian <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>.</p>

<p>He falls in with dwarfs, Danish <b>A</b>, <b>H</b>, Norwegian <i>A</i>;
trolds, Danish <b>I</b>; elves and dwarfs, Norwegian <b>B</b>, and a
variation of <b>A</b>: elsewhere it is elves.</p>

<p>There is naturally some diversity in the gifts which the elf offers
Oluf in order to induce him to dance with her. He more commonly replies
that the offer is a handsome one, 'kan jeg vel få,' but dance with her
he cannot; sometimes that his true-love has already given him that,
or two, three, seven such, Danish <b>D a</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>T</b>,
<b>X</b>, <b>Y</b>.</p>

<p>If he will not dance with her, the elf threatens him with sore
sickness, Danish <b>B</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>Z</b>, <b>Ø</b>,
Norwegian <b>A</b>, Swedish <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>; a great misfortune,
Danish <b>F</b>, Swedish <b>A</b>; sharp knives, Danish <b>P</b>; it
shall cost him his young life, Danish <b>D a, b</b>, <b>T</b>, <b>Y</b>.</p>

<p>Oluf dances with the elves, obviously under compulsion, in Danish
<b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>G-N</b>, <b>S</b>, <b>T</b>, <b>U</b>, <b>X</b>,
<b>Y</b>, Swedish <b>F</b>, and only in these. He dances till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-377" id="Pg_1-377">[Pg 377]</a></span> both
his boots are full of blood, <b>D a</b> 15, <b>D b</b> 4, <b>G</b> 5,
<b>I</b> 11, <b>K</b> 5, <b>L</b> 5, <b>M</b> 6, <b>N</b> 7, <b>S</b> 6
[shoes], <b>T</b> 10, <b>U</b> 5, <b>X</b> 8, <b>Y</b> 7; he dances so
long that he is nigh dead, <b>I</b> 12.</p>

<p>The hard choice between dying at once or lying sick seven years is
found, out of the Färöe ballads, only in Danish <b>H</b> 8, <b>M</b>
8, <b>O</b> 4, <b>Q</b> 2, <b>S</b> 8. Norwegian ballads, like English
<b>C</b>, present an option between living with elves and dying,
essentially a repetition of the terms under which Peter of Staufenberg
weds the fairy, that he shall forfeit his life if he takes a mortal
wife. So Norwegian</p>

<p>There is no answer.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="linenum">6</span><br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>To which Olaf answers that he lists not to go off a sick man, and he
cannot marry an elf.</p>

<p>The two last stanzas of English <b>C</b>, which correspond to these,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Will ye lie there an die, Clerk Colin,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Will ye lie there an die?<br /></span>

<span class="i2">I will lie here an die,'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>may originally have come in before the mermaid and the clerk parted;
but her visit to him as he lies in bed is paralleled by that of the
fairy to Staufenberg after he has been persuaded to give up what he had
been brought to regard as an infernal <i>liaison</i>; and certainly Clerk
Colin's language might lead us to think that some priest had been with
him, too.</p>

<p>Upon Oluf's now seeking to make his escape through the elves' flame,
ring, dance, etc., Norwegian <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>E</b>,
<b>G</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>K</b>, the elf-woman strikes at him
with a gold band, her wand, hand, a branch or twig; gives him a blow on
the cheek, between the shoulders, over his white neck; stabs him in the
heart, gives him knife-strokes five, nine; sickness follows the stroke,
or blood: Danish <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>N</b>, <b>O</b>,
<b>R</b>, <b>V</b>, <b>Z</b>, <b>Æ</b>, <b>Ø</b>, Swedish <b>D</b>,
<b>G</b>, Norwegian <b>A-E</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>I</b>, Icelandic. The
knife-stabs are delayed till the elves have put him on his horse in
Danish <b>D</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>X</b>; as he sprang to his horse the
knives rang after him, <b>H</b>. "Ride home," they say, "you shall
not live more than a day" [five hours, two hours], Danish <b>A</b>,
<b>C</b>, <b>K-N</b>, <b>S</b>, <b>U</b>, <b>V</b>. His hair fades,
Danish <b>E</b>; his cheek pales, Danish <b>E</b>, Norwegian <b>A</b>;
sickness follows him home, Swedish <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>,
<b>E</b>; the blood is running out of the wound in his heart, Swedish
<b>G</b>; when he reaches his father's house both his boots are full of
blood, Danish <b>R</b>, <b>Æ</b>.</p>

<p>His mother [father] is standing without, and asks, Why so pale? Why
runs the blood from thy saddle? Oluf, in some instances, pretends that
his horse, not being sure-footed, had stumbled, and thrown him against
a tree, but is told, or of himself adds, that he has been among the
elves. He asks one or the other of his family to take his horse, bring
a priest, make his bed, put on a bandage. He says he shall never rise
from his bed, Swedish <b>C</b>, Danish <b>F</b>; fears he shall not
live till the priest comes, Danish <b>O</b>, <b>P</b>.</p>

<p>The important passage which relates the arrival of the bride, the
ominous circumstances at the bridegroom's house, the attempts to keep
the bride in ignorance of his death, and her final discovery that she
is widowed before marriage, occupies some thirty stanzas in Dan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-378" id="Pg_1-378">[Pg 378]</a></span>ish
<b>A</b>, the oldest of all copies; in Danish <b>B</b> it is reduced
to six; in other Danish versions it has a range of from fifteen to
two; but, shorter or longer, it is found in all versions but <b>R</b>,
<b>Ø</b>, and the fragments <b>G</b>, <b>L</b>, <b>Q</b>, <b>X</b>,
<b>Z</b>. All the Swedish versions have a similar scene, extending from
three to nine stanzas, with the exception of <b>G</b> and of <b>A</b>,
which latter should perhaps be treated as a fragment. In Norwegian
<b>A</b>, again, this part of the story fills ten stanzas; <b>B</b>
lacks it, but <b>C-H</b> (which have not been published in full) have
it, and probably other unpublished copies.</p>

<p>The bride is expected the next day, Danish <b>D</b>, <b>F</b>,
<b>I</b>, <b>K</b>, <b>N</b>, <b>O</b>, <b>S</b>, <b>T</b>, <b>U</b>,
Swedish <b>A</b>, <b>D</b>. In Danish <b>A</b> Oluf begs his brothers,
shortly after his reaching home, to set out to meet her; he fears she
may arrive that very night, Danish <b>Æ</b>. "What shall I answer your
young bride?" asks the mother, Danish <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>,
etc., Swedish <b>H</b>. "Tell her that I have gone to the wood, to hunt
and shoot, to try my horse and my dogs," Danish <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>,
<b>D</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>K</b>, <b>O</b>, <b>S</b>,
<b>T</b>, <b>U</b>, Swedish <b>D</b>, <b>H</b>, Norwegian <b>A</b>,
<b>L</b>; in Danish <b>N</b> only, "Say I died in the night." Oluf now
makes his will; he wishes to assign his bride to his brother, Danish
<b>L</b>, <b>O</b>, <b>R</b>, Norwegian <b>C</b>, <b>F</b>; he dies
before the bride can come to him. (Norwegian <b>F</b> seems to have
gone wrong here.)</p>

<p>The bride, with her train, comes in the morning, Danish <b>B</b>,
<b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>M</b>, <b>T</b>, Swedish <b>D</b>,
Norwegian <b>D</b>; Swedish <b>C</b> makes her wait for her bridegroom
several days. As she passes through the town the bells are tolling, and
she anxiously asks why, Danish <b>A</b>, <b>K</b>, <b>O</b>, <b>S</b>,
<b>U</b>; she is told that it is a custom there to ring when the bride
comes, Danish <b>A</b>, Swedish <b>B</b>. In Danish <b>H</b>, though
it is day, she sees a light burning in Oluf's chamber, and this alarms
her. When she comes to the house, Oluf's mother is weeping, all the
ladies are weeping, or there are other signs of grief, Danish <b>A</b>,
<b>C</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>U</b>, <b>Æ</b>. When she asks the reason, no
one can answer, or she is told that a woman, a fair knight, is dead,
<b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>H</b>. Now she asks, Where is Oluf, who should
have come to meet me, should have been here to receive me? Danish
<b>K</b>, <b>O</b>, <b>S</b>, <b>U</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>I</b>,
<b>T</b>, etc. They conduct the bride into the hall and seat her on
the bride bench; knights come and go; they pour out mead and wine.
"Where is Oluf," she asks again; the mother replies, as best she can,
that Oluf is gone to the wood, Danish <b>B</b>, <b>H</b>, Norwegian
<b>A</b>, <b>D</b>, Swedish <b>H</b>, etc. "Does he then care more
for that than for his bride?" Danish <b>A</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>I</b>,
<b>M</b>, etc., Swedish <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, Norwegian <b>A</b>,
<b>E</b>, <b>G</b>.</p>

<p>The truth is now avowed that Oluf is dead, Danish <b>A</b>, <b>D</b>,
<b>I</b>, <b>T</b>, <b>Y</b>, <b>Æ</b>, Swedish <b>B</b>, Norwegian
<b>G</b>. The bride begs that she may see the dead, Danish <b>A</b>,
<b>C</b>, <b>P</b>, <b>Æ</b>, Swedish <b>F</b>, Norwegian <b>D</b>,
<b>E</b>, and makes her way to the room where Oluf is lying. She puts
aside the cloths that cover him, or the curtains, or the flowers,
Danish <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>K</b>, <b>V</b>, etc., Swedish <b>C</b>,
<b>D</b>, Norwegian <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>G</b>; says a word
or two to her lover, Danish <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>H</b>,
Swedish <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, Norwegian <b>G</b>; kisses him, Danish
<b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>H</b>; her heart breaks, Danish <b>A</b>,
<b>C</b>; she swoons dead at his feet, Danish <b>K</b>, <b>M</b>,
<b>S</b>, <b>U</b>. In Norwegian <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, she
kills herself with Olaf's sword; in Swedish <b>E</b>, with her own
knife. In Danish <b>R</b> she dies in Oluf's mother's arms. On the
morrow, when it was day, in Oluf's house three corpses lay: the first
was Oluf, the second his maid, the third his mother, of grief was she
dead: Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, <i>passim</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1_355" id="FNanchor_1_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a></p>

somewhat abridged literal translation, in French.</p>

<p>The count [Nann] and his wife were married at the respective ages of
thirteen and twelve. The next year a son was born [a boy and girl,
<b>D</b>]. The young husband asked the countess if she had a fancy for
anything. She owned that she should like a bit of game, and he took his
gun [lance] and went to the wood. At the entrance of the wood he met a
fairy [a dwarf, <b>E</b>; a hind, <b>G</b>; saw a white hind, which he
pursued hotly till evening, when he dismounted near a grotto to drink,
and there was a korrigan, sitting by the spring, combing her hair with
a gold comb, <b>D</b>]. The fairy [dwarf, hind] said that she had long
been looking for him, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>G</b>.
"Now that I have met you, you must marry me."<a name="FNanchor_1_357" id="FNanchor_1_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> "Marry you? Not I. I
am married already." "Choose either to die in three days or to lie sick
in bed seven [three] years" [and then die, <b>C</b>]. He would rather
die in three days, for his wife is very young, and would suffer greatly
[he would rather die that instant than wed a korrigan, <b>D</b>].</p>

<p>On reaching home the young man called to his mother to make his bed; he
should never get up again. [His mother, in <b>C</b> 21, says, Do not
weep so: it is not every sick man that dies, as in Danish <b>A</b> 22.]
He recounted his meeting with the fairy, and begged that his wife might
not be informed of his death.</p>

<p>The countess asked, What has happened to my husband, that he does
not come to see me? She was told that he had gone to the wood to get
her something, <b>A</b> [to Paris, <b>C</b>; to the city, <b>D</b>].
Why were the men-servants weeping? The best horse had been drowned
in bathing him, <b>A</b>, <b>E</b>; had been eaten by the wolves,
<b>B</b>; had broken his neck, <b>C</b>; had died, <b>F</b>. They were
not to weep; others should be bought. And why were the maids weeping?
Linen had been lost in washing, <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>;
the best silver cover had been stolen, <b>F</b>. They must not weep;
the loss would be supplied. Why were the priests chanting? [the bells
tolling, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>]. A poor person whom they had lodged had
died in the night, <b>A-E</b> [a young prince had died, <b>F</b>].
What dress should she wear for her churching,&mdash;red or blue? <b>D</b>,
<b>F</b>.<a name="FNanchor_1_358" id="FNanchor_1_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> The custom had come in of wearing black [she asks for
red, they give her black, <b>F</b>]. On arriving at the church, or
cemetery, she saw that the earth had been disturbed; her pew was hung
with black, <b>B</b>; why was this? "I can no longer conceal it," said
her mother-in-law: "your husband is dead." She died upon the spot,
<b>A</b>, <b>D</b>. "Take my keys, take care of my son; I will stay
with his father," <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>. "Your son is dead, your daughter
is dead," <b>F</b>.<a name="FNanchor_1_359" id="FNanchor_1_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a></p>

<p>This ballad has spread, apparently from Brittany, over all France.
No distinct trace of the fairy remains, however, except in a single
case. The versions that have been made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-380" id="Pg_1-380">[Pg 380]</a></span> public, so far as they have
come to my knowledge, are as follows, resemblance to the Breton ballad
principally directing the arrangement.</p>

<p>The name of the hero in the French ballad is mostly Renaud, or some
modification of Renaud: Jean Renaud, <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>U</b>;
Renom, <b>AA</b>; Arnaud, <b>C</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>L</b>, <b>Y</b>,
<b>BB</b>; L'Arnaud l'Infant, <b>P</b>; Louis Renaud, brother of Jean,
<b>F</b>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-381" id="Pg_1-381">[Pg 381]</a></span> It is Louis in <b>A</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>J</b>, <b>V</b>. He is
king, or of the royal family, <b>F</b>, <b>M</b>, <b>N</b>, <b>O</b>,
<b>Q</b>, <b>W</b>, <b>BB</b>, <b>CC</b>, <b>GG</b>; count, <b>Y</b>;
Renaud le grand, <b>H</b>, <b>Z</b>. In <b>A</b>, while he is walking
in his meadows, he meets Death, who asks him, peremptorily, Would you
rather die this very night, or languish seven years? and he answers
that he prefers to die at once. Here there is a very plain trace of the
older fairy. He is mortally hurt, while hunting, by a wolf, <b>B</b>;
by a boar, <b>DD</b>. But in more than twenty versions he returns
from war, often with a horrible wound, "apportant son c&#339;ur dans sa
main," <b>C</b>; "tenant ses tripes dans ses mains," <b>N</b>; "oque
ses tripes on sa main, sen estoumac on sen chapea, sen cûr covert de
sen mentea," <b>G</b>; etc. In <b>F</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>J</b> he comes
home in a dying state from prison (to which he was consigned, according
to <b>I</b>, for robbing a church!). In these versions the story is
confused with that of another ballad, existing in Breton, and very
likely in French, 'Komt ar Chapel,' 'Le Comte des Chapelles,' Luzel,
I, 456/457, or 'Le Page de Louis XIII,' Villemarqué, Barzaz-Breiz, p.
301. A fragment of a corresponding Italian ballad is given by Nigra,
Romania, XI, 397, No 9.</p>

<p>Renaud, as it will be convenient to call the hero, coming home triste
et chagrin, <b>F</b>, <b>P</b>, <b>U b, c</b>, triste et bien malau
<b>Y</b>, receives on his arriving felicitations from his mother on
account of the birth of a son. He has no heart to respond to these: "Ni
de ma femme, ni de mon fils, je ne saurais me réjoui." He asks that
his bed may be made, with precautions against his wife's hearing. At
midnight he is dead.</p>

<p>The wife, hearing the men-servants weeping, asks her mother-in-law
the cause. The best horse [horses] has been found dead in the stable,
has strayed away, etc., <b>B</b>, <b>D-S</b>, <b>GG</b>. "No matter
for that," says the wife; "when Renaud comes he will bring better,"
<b>B</b>, <b>D-G</b>, <b>L-Q</b>, <b>GG</b>. The maids are heard
weeping; why is that? They have lost, or injured, sheets in the
washing, <b>B</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>J</b>. When Renaud
comes we shall have better, <b>B</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>G</b>. Or
a piece of plate has been lost or broken, <b>A</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>H</b>,
<b>I</b>, <b>K</b>, <b>O</b>. [It is children with the toothache,
<b>F</b>, <b>U a, b, c, d</b>]. "What is this chanting which I hear?"
It is a procession, making the tour of the house: <b>B</b>, <b>D-F</b>,
<b>L</b>, <b>P-X</b>, <b>GG</b>. "What gown shall I wear when I go to
church?" Black is the color for women at their churching, <b>B</b>,
<b>F</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>L</b>, <b>M</b>, <b>O</b>, <b>P</b>, <b>V</b>,
<b>Y</b>; black is more becoming, plus joli, plus convenant, plus
conséquent, <b>A</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>K</b>, <b>N</b>, <b>R</b>,
<b>X</b>, <b>BB</b>, <b>DD</b>, <b>GG</b>; "quittez le ros', quittez le
gris, prenez le noir, pour mieux choisir," etc., <b>Q</b>, <b>W</b>,
<b>U</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>S</b>, <b>T</b>.</p>

<p>Besides these four questions, all of which occur in Breton ballads,
there are two which are met with in many versions, always coming before
the last. "What is this pounding (frapper, cogner, taper) which I
hear?" It is carpenters, or masons, repairing some part of the house,
<b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>K</b>, <b>L</b>, <b>N</b>, <b>P-U</b>, <b>W</b>;
<b>A</b>, <b>V</b>, <b>X</b>, <b>AA</b>; <b>GG</b>. "Why are the bells
ringing?" For a procession, or because a distinguished personage
has come, has died, etc., <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>F-L</b>, <b>Q</b>,
<b>R</b>, <b>W</b>, <b>Y</b>, <b>AA</b>, <b>DD</b>, <b>GG</b>. On the
way to church [or cemetery] herdboys or others say to one another, as
the lady goes by, That is the wife of the king, the seigneur, that was
buried last night, or the like; and the mother-in-law has again to
put aside the lady's question as to what they were saying, <b>D</b>,
<b>E</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>L-P</b>, <b>S</b>, <b>T</b>, <b>X</b>,
<b>Y</b>, <b>FF</b>, <b>GG</b>.</p>

<p>Flambeaux or candles are burning at the church, <b>E</b>, <b>V</b>; a
taper is presented to the widow, <b>M</b>, or holy water, <b>N</b>,
<b>T</b>, <b>Z</b>, <b>GG</b>; the church is hung with black, <b>D</b>,
<b>O</b>, <b>FF</b>; the funeral is going on, <b>AA</b>, <b>CC</b>.
"Whose is this new monument?" "What a fine tomb!" <b>M</b>, <b>N</b>,
<b>R</b>, <b>T</b>, <b>Z</b>, <b>GG</b>. The scene in other cases
is transferred to the cemetery. "Why has the earth been disturbed?"
"What new monument is this?" <b>A</b>, <b>DD</b>; <b>C</b>, <b>F</b>,
<b>I</b>, <b>J</b>, <b>P</b>. In <b>B</b> the tomb is in the garden; in
<b>L</b>, <b>S</b>, <b>X</b>, <b>BB</b> the place is not defined.</p>

<p>The young wife utters a piercing shriek, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>K</b>,
<b>L</b>, <b>N</b>. Open earth, split tomb, split tiles! <b>A</b>,
<b>B</b>, <b>Q</b>, <b>R</b>, <b>V</b>, <b>W</b>, <b>X</b>, <b>Y</b>;
I will stay with my husband, will die with my husband, will not go
back, <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>M</b>, <b>N</b>, <b>Q</b>,
<b>R</b>, <b>S</b>, <b>X</b>, <b>Y</b>, <b>Z</b>, <b>BB</b>, <b>CC</b>,
<b>GG</b>. She bids her mother take her keys, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>,
<b>G</b>, <b>L</b>, <b>M</b>, <b>P</b>, <b>Y</b>, <b>BB</b>, <b>CC</b>,
<b>GG</b>, and commits her son [children] to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-382" id="Pg_1-382">[Pg 382]</a></span> kinsfolk, to bring up
piously, <b>B</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>J</b>, <b>L</b>, <b>M</b>,
<b>O</b>, <b>Z</b>, <b>BB</b>, <b>CC</b>. In <b>H</b>, <b>P</b>,
<b>Q</b>, <b>W</b>, <b>X</b>, <b>Y</b> the earth opens, and in the last
four it encloses her. In <b>K</b> heaven is rent by her shriek, and she
sees her husband in light (who says, strangely, that his mouth smacks
of rot); he bids her bring up the children as Christians. Heaven opens
to her prayer in <b>AA</b>, and a voice cries, Wife, come up hither!
In <b>GG</b> the voice from heaven says, Go to your child: I will keep
your husband safe. There are other variations.<a name="FNanchor_1_361" id="FNanchor_1_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a></p>

<p><b>G</b>, <b>T</b>, <b>I</b> say expressly that Renaud's wife died
the next day, or after hearing three masses, or soon after. <b>M</b>,
<b>O</b>, by a feeble modern perversion, make her go into a convent.</p>

<p><b>Italian</b> ballads cover very much the same ground as the French.

these are from recent tradition.</p>

<p>The name Rinaldo, Rinald, is found only in <i>I</i>, <b>C</b>, and the
latter has also Lüis. Lüis is the name in <b>E</b>; Carlino, Carlin, in
<b>J</b>, <b>H</b>; Angiolino, Anzolin, <b>L</b>, <b>G</b>; Cagnolino,
<b>M</b>. The rank is king in <b>C</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>H-K</b>; prince,
<b>D</b>; count, <b>G</b>, <b>L</b>, <b>M</b>.</p>

<p><b>A</b> and <b>B</b>, corrupted fragments though they be, retain clear
traces of the ancient form of the story, and of the English variety
of that form. Under the bridge of the Rella [Diamantina] a woman is
washing clothes, gh' è 'na lavandera. A knight passes, <b>B</b>, and
apparently accosts the laundress. She moves into the water, and the
knight after her; the knight embraces her, <b>A</b>. Dowy rade he
hame, el va a cà tüto mojà, <b>A</b>. In <b>B</b> (passing over some
verses which have intruded) he has many knife-stabs, and his horse many
also.<a name="FNanchor_1_362" id="FNanchor_1_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> He asks his mother to put him to bed and his horse into the
stable, and gives directions about his funeral.</p>

<p>All of the story which precedes the hero's return home is either
omitted, <b>D</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>J</b>, <b>K</b>, <b>L</b>, or abridged
to a single stanza: ven da la cassa lo re Rinald, ven da la cassa, l'è
tüt ferì, <b>C</b>; ven da la guerra re Rinaldo, ven da la guerra, l'è
tüt ferì, <b>I</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>H</b>; save that <b>G</b>, which like
<b>C</b> makes him to have been hunting (and to have been bitten by a
mad dog), adds that, while he was hunting, his wife had given birth to
a boy. <b>M</b> has an entirely false beginning: Count Cagnolino was
disposed to marry, but wished to be secure about his wife's previous
life. He had a marble statue in his garden which moved its eyes when
any girl that had gone astray presented herself before it. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-383" id="Pg_1-383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
daughter of Captain Tartaglia having been declined, for reason, and
another young woman espoused, Tartaglia killed the count while they
were hunting.</p>

<p>The wounded man, already feeling the approach of death, <b>F</b>,
<b>G</b>, <b>L</b>, asks that his bed may be made; he shall die before
the morrow, <b>D</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>J</b>; let not his wife know,
<b>F</b>, <b>G</b>. The wife asks why the men-servants, coachmen, are
weeping, and is told that they have drowned [lost] some of the horses,
<b>C-J</b>, <b>M</b> [have burned the king's carriage, <b>K</b>]. We
will get others when the king comes, she answers, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>,
<b>H</b> [when I get up, <b>F</b>, as in Breton <b>A</b>]. Why are
the maids weeping? The maids have lost sheets or towels in washing,
<b>F</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>K</b>; have scorched the shirts in ironing,
<b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>H</b>. When the king comes, he will buy or bring
better, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>H</b> [when I get up, <b>F</b>, as in
Breton <b>A</b>]. Why are the priests chanting? For a great feast
to-morrow, <b>F</b>. Why are the carpenters at work? They are making
a cradle for your boy, <b>C-E</b>, <b>H-K</b>. Why do the bells ring?
A great lord is dead; in honor of somebody or something; <b>C</b>,
<b>E-L</b>. Why does not Anzolin come to see me? He has gone a-hunting,
<b>G</b>, <b>L</b>. What dress shall I put on to go to church? [When
I get up I shall put on red, <b>F</b>, <b>I</b>.] You in black and I
in gray, as in our country is the way, <b>C-F</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>I</b>
[<b>H</b> moda a <i>Paris</i>, by corruption of dël pais]; I white, you
gray, <b>J</b>; you will look well in black, <b>M</b>; put on red, or
put on white, or put on black for custom's sake, <b>G</b>.</p>

<p>The children in the street say, That is the wife of the lord who was
buried, or the people look at the lady in a marked way, <b>C</b>,
<b>J</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>M</b>; and why is this? For the last time the
mother-in-law puts off the question. At the church, under the family
bench, there is a grave new made, and now it has to be said that the
husband is buried there, <b>C-K</b>, <b>M</b>.</p>

<p>A conclusion is wanting in half of the ballads, and what there is
is corrupted in others. The widow commends her boy to her husband's
mother, <b>G</b>, <b>M</b>, and says she will die with her dear one,
<b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>J</b>, <b>M</b>. In <b>C</b>, as in French
<b>V</b>, she wishes to speak to her husband. If the dead ever spake
to the quick, she would speak once to her dear Lüis; if the quick
ever spake to the dead, she would speak once to her dear husband. In
<b>G</b> she bids the grave unlock, that she may come into the arms of
her beloved, and then bids it close, that in his arms she may stay: cf.
French <b>Y</b>, <b>Q</b>, <b>X</b>, <b>R</b>, <b>AA</b>.</p>

<p>The story of the Italian ballad, under the title of 'Il Conte
Angiolino,' was given in epitome by Luigi Carrer, in his Prose e
Poesie, Venice, 1838, IV, 81 f, before any copy had been published
(omitted in later editions). According to Carrer's version, the lady,
hearing bells, and seeing from her windows the church lighted up as for
some office, extracts the fact from her mother-in-law on the spot, and
then, going to the church and seeing her husband's tomb, prays that it
would open and receive her.</p>

<p>A fragment of an Italian ballad given by Nigra, Romania, XI, 396, No 8,
describes three card players, quarrelling over their game, as passing
from words to knives, and from knives to pistols, and one of the party,
the king of Spain, as being wounded in the fray. He rides home with a
depressed air, and asks his mother to make his bed, for he shall be
dead at midnight and his horse at dawn. There is a confusion of two
stories here, as will be seen from Spanish ballads which are to be
spoken of. Both stories are mixed with the original adventure of the
mermaid in 'Il Cavaliere della bella spada,' already referred to as
<b>B</b>. In this last the knight has a hundred and fifty stabs, and
his horse ninety.<a name="FNanchor_1_363" id="FNanchor_1_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a></p>

<p>Nigra has added to the valuable and beautiful ballads furnished
to Romania, XI, a tale (p. 398) from the province of Turin, which
preserves the earlier portion of the Breton story. A hunter comes
upon a beautiful woman under a rock. She requires him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-384" id="Pg_1-384">[Pg 384]</a></span> marry her,
and is told by the hunter that he is already married. The beautiful
woman, who is of course a fairy, presents the hunter with a box for his
wife, which he is not to open. This box contains an explosive girdle,
intended to be her death; and the hunter's curiosity impelling him to
examine the gift, he is so much injured by a detonation which follows
that he can just drag himself home to die.</p>

<p><b>Spanish.</b> This ballad is very common in Catalonia, and has
been found in Asturias. Since it is also known in Portugal, we may
presume that it might be recovered in other parts of the peninsula.

<p>The name of the husband is Don Joan de Sevilla, <b>D</b>, Don Joan,
<b>F</b>, Don Olalbo, <b>I</b>, Don Francisco, <b>J</b>, Don Pedro,
<b>K</b>. His wife, a princess, <b>A</b>, <b>G</b>, has given birth
to a child, or is on the eve of so doing. The gentleman is away from
home, or is about to leave home on a pilgrimage of a year and a day,
<b>A</b>, <b>G</b>; has gone to war, <b>D</b>; to a hunt, <b>I</b>,
<b>K</b>. He dies just as he returns home or is leaving home, or away
from home, in other versions, but in <b>K</b> comes back in a dying
condition, and begs that his state may be concealed from his wife. The
lady, hearing a commotion in the house, and asking the cause, is told
that it is the noisy mirth of the servants, <b>A-D</b>. There is music,
chanting, tolling of bells; and this is said to be for a great person
who has died, <b>B</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>A</b>. In <b>B</b>, <b>D</b>, the
wife asks, Can it be for my husband? In <b>J</b> the mother-in-law
explains her own sorrowful demeanor as occasioned by the death of an
uncle, and we are informed that the burial was without bells, in order
that the new mother might not hear. In <b>J</b> only do we have the
question, Where is my husband? He has been summoned to court, says the
mother-in-law, where, as a favorite, he will stay a year and ten days.
When should the young mother go to mass? Peasants go after a fortnight,
tradesfolk after forty days, etc.; she, as a great lady, will wait
a year and a day, <b>A</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>I</b>, a year, <b>B</b>, a
year and ten days, <b>J</b>. What dress should she wear, silk, gold
tissue, silver? etc. Black would become her best, <b>A</b>, <b>J</b>,
<b>K</b>. [Doña Ana, in <b>K</b>, like the lady in Italian <b>G</b>,
resists the suggestion of mourning, as proper only for a widow, and
appears in a costume de Pascua florida: in some other copies also
she seems to wear a gay dress.] The people, the children, point to
her, and say, There is the widow, and her mother-in-law parries the
inquiry why she is the object of remark; but the truth is avowed when
they see a grave digging, and the wife asks for whom it is, <b>A</b>.
In <b>J</b> the lady sees a monument in the church, hung with black,
reads her husband's name, and swoons. <b>B</b>, <b>C</b> make the
mother's explanation follow upon the children's talk. In <b>K</b> the
announcement is made first by a shepherd, then confirmed by gaping
spectators and by a rejected lover. The widow commends her child to its
grandmother, and says she will go to her husband in heaven, <b>A-D</b>;
dies on the spot, <b>K</b>; Don Francisco dies in March, Doña Ana in
May, <b>J</b>.</p>

<p>'Don Joan y Don Ramon' is a ballad in which a young man returns to his
mother mortally wounded, and therefore would be likely to blend in the
memory of reciters with any other ballad in which the same incident
occurred. A version from the Balearic Islands may be put first, which
has not yet taken up any characteristic part of the story of Renaud:
Recuerdos y Bellezas de España, Mallorca, p. 336, 1842 == Milá, 1853, p.
114, No 15, Briz, III, 172; Die Balearen in Wort und Bild geschildert,
by the Archduke Ludwig Salvator, Leipzig, 1871, II, 556.<a name="FNanchor_1_364" id="FNanchor_1_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a></p>

<p>Don Joan and Don Ramon are returning from the chase. Don Ramon falls
from his horse;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-385" id="Pg_1-385">[Pg 385]</a></span> Don Joan rides off. Don Ramon's mother sees her son
coming through a field, gathering plants to heal his wounds. "What is
the matter?" she asks; "you are pale." "I have been bled, and they made
a mistake." "Ill luck to the barber!" "Curse him not; it is the last
time. Between me and my horse we have nine and twenty lance thrusts;
the horse has nine and I the rest. The horse will die to-night and I
in the morning. Bury him in the best place in the stable, and me in St
Eulalia; lay a sword crosswise over my grave, and if it is asked who
killed me, let the answer be, Don Joan de la cassada."</p>

<p>There are numerous Catalan versions, and most of them add something
to this story: Milá, 2d ed., 'El guerrero mal herido,' p. 171, No
210, <b>A-F</b>, <b>A<sub>1</sub>-G<sub>1</sub></b>, <b>A<sub>11</sub></b>; Briz, III, 171 f,
two copies. These disagree considerably as to the cause of the hero's
death, and the names are not constant. In <b>A<sub>1</sub></b> of Milá, as in
the Balearic ballad, Don Joan and Don Ramon are coming from the chase,
and have a passage at lances; Don Joan is left dead, and Don Ramon is
little short of it. <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, of Milá, tell us that Don Pedro
died on the field of battle and Don Joan came home mortally wounded.
<b>E</b> says that Don Joan and Don Ramon come from the chase, but Don
Joan immediately says that he comes from a great battle. It is battle
in <b>F<sub>1</sub></b>, in <b>E<sub>1</sub></b> (with Gastó returning), and in both
the Catalan copies of Briz, the hero being Don Joan in the first of
these last, and in the other nameless. The wounded man says he has
been badly bled, Milá, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>A<sub>1</sub></b>, <b>C<sub>1</sub></b>,
Briz 2; he and his horse have lance wounds fifty-nine, thirty-nine,
twenty-nine, etc., the horse nine and he the rest, Milá, <b>A</b>,
<b>B</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>A<sub>1</sub></b>, Briz 1. His mother informs him that
his wife has borne a child, "a boy like the morning star," Briz 1, and
says that if he will go to the best chamber he will find her surrounded
by dames and ladies. This gives him no pleasure; he does not care for
wife, nor dames, nor ladies, nor boys, nor morning stars: Briz 1, Milá,
<b>A<sub>1</sub>-G<sub>1</sub></b>. He asks to have his bed made, Milá, <b>A-D</b>,
<b>B<sub>1</sub></b>, <b>C<sub>1</sub></b>, Briz 1, 2, for he shall die at midnight
and his horse at dawn, <b>A-D</b>, <b>A<sub>1</sub></b>, Briz 2, and gives
directions for his burial and that of his horse. Let the bells toll
when he is dead, and when people ask for whom it is, the answer will
be, For Don Joan, Briz 1, Gastó, Milá, <b>E<sub>1</sub></b>, who was killed in
battle. Let his arms be put over the place where his horse is buried,
and when people ask whose arms they are his mother will say, My son's,
who died in battle, Milá <b>A</b>, <b>B<sub>1</sub></b>. Let a drawn sword be
laid across his grave, and let those that ask who killed him be told,
Don Joan, at the chase, Milá, <b>A<sub>1</sub></b>.<a name="FNanchor_1_365" id="FNanchor_1_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a></p>

<p>We have, probably, to do with two different ballads here, versions
<b>A-F</b> of Milá's 'Guerrero mal herido,' and Briz's second,
belonging with 'Don Joan y Don Ramon,' while <b>A<sub>1</sub>-G<sub>1</sub></b> of
Milá, and Briz's first, represent a ballad of the Renaud class. It is,
however, possible that the first series may be imperfect copies of the
second.</p>

<p>'Don Joan y Don Ramon' has agreements with Italian <b>B</b>, <b>A</b>:
in <b>B</b>, particularly, we note the hundred and fifty stabs of the
knight and the ninety of his horse.</p>

<p><b>Portuguese.</b> A good Portuguese version, 'D. Pedro e D. Leonarda,'
in fifty short verses, unfortunately lacking the conclusion, has been
lately communicated to Romania (XI, 585) by Leite de Vasconcellos. Dom
Pedro went hunting, to be gone a year and a day, but was compelled to
return home owing to a malady which seized him. His mother greets him
with the information that his wife has given birth to a son. "Comfort
and cheer her," he says, "and for me make a bed, which I shall never
rise from." The wife asks, Where is my husband, that he does not come
to see me? "He has gone a-hunting for a year and a day," replies the
mother. What is this commotion in the house? "Only visitors." But the
bells are tolling! Could it be for my husband? "No, no; it is for a
feast-day." When do women go to mass after child-birth? "Some in three
weeks and some in two, but a lady of your rank after a year and a day."
And what color do they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-386" id="Pg_1-386">[Pg 386]</a></span> wear? "Some light blue and some a thousand
wonders, but you, as a lady of rank, will go in mourning." The ballad
stops abruptly with a half-pettish, half-humorous imprecation from the
daughter-in-law against the mother for keeping her shut up so long.</p>

<p>There is a Slavic ballad, which, like the versions that are so popular
with the Romance nations, abridges the first part of the story, and
makes the interest turn upon the gradual discovery of the hero's death,
but in other respects agrees with northern tradition.</p>

&#324;e&#7811;esta,' 'The Weeping Bride' (the last eight stanzas, the ten
before being in no connection).</p>

<p>The hero on his wedding day is making ready his horse to fetch the
bride; for he is, as in the Scandinavian ballads, not yet a married
man. His mother, Bohemian <b>A</b>, ascertaining his intention, begs
him not to go himself with the bridal escort. Obviously she has a
premonition of misfortune. Herman will never invite guests, and not go
for them. The mother, in an access of passion, exclaims, If you go,
may you break your neck, and never come back! Here we are reminded of
the Färöe ballad. Bohemian <b>C</b>, <b>D</b> make the forebodings to
rise in Herman's mind, not in his mother's. The mother opposes the
match in Bohemian <b>E</b>, and the sister wishes that he may break his
neck. Wendish <b>A</b> has nothing of opposition or bodement before
the start, but the crows go winging about the young men who are going
for the bride, and caw a horrible song, how the bridegroom shall fall
from his horse and break his neck. The train sets off with a band of
trumpets, drums, and stringed instruments, or, Bohemian <b>D</b>, with
a discharge of a hundred muskets, and when they come to a linden in
a meadow Herman's horse "breaks his foot," and the rider his neck;
Bohemian <b>D</b>, when they come to a copse in a meadow the hundred
pieces are again discharged, and Herman is mortally wounded. His
friends stand debating what they shall do. The dying man bids them keep
on: since the bride cannot be his, she shall be his youngest brother's,
Bohemian <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>; cf. Danish <b>L</b>, <b>O</b>, <b>R</b>,
Norwegian <b>C</b>, <b>F</b>. The train arrives at the bride's house;
the bride comes out to greet them, but, not seeing the bridegroom,
inquires affrightedly what has become of him. They pretend that he has
remained at home to see to the tables. The mother is reluctant to give
them the bride, but finally yields. When the train comes again to the
linden in the mead, Dorothy sees blood. It is Herman's! she cries;
but they assure her that it is the blood of a deer that Herman had
killed for the feast. They reach Herman's house, where the bride has an
appalling reception, which need not be particularized.</p>

<p>In Bohemian <b>A</b>, while they are at supper (or at half-eve == three
in the afternoon), a death-bell is heard. Dorothy turns pale. For whom
are they tolling? Surely it is for Herman. They tell her that Herman
is lying in his room with a bad headache, and that the bell is ringing
for a child. But she guesses the truth, sinks down and dies, <b>a</b>.
She wears two knives in her hair, and thrusts one of them into her
heart, <b>b</b>. The two are buried in one grave. In Bohemian <b>B</b>
the bell sounds for the first time as the first course is brought on,
and a second time when the second course comes. The bride is told in
each case that the knell is for a child. Upon the third sounding, when
the third course is brought in, they tell her that it is for Herman.
She seizes two knives and runs to the graveyard: with one she digs
herself a grave, and with the other stabs herself. In the Wendish
fragment <b>B</b>, at the first and second course (there is no bell)
the bride asks where the bridegroom is, and at the third repeats the
question with tears. She is told that he is ranging the woods, killing
game for his wedding. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-387" id="Pg_1-387">[Pg 387]</a></span> Bohemian <b>C</b> the bell tolls while they
are getting the table ready. The bride asks if it is for Herman, and
is told that it is for a child. When they sit down to table, the
bells toll again. For whom should this be? For whom but Herman? She
springs out of the window, and the catastrophe is the same as in
Bohemian <b>B</b>. In <b>D</b> the bride hears the bell as the train
is approaching the house, and they say it is for a child. On entering
the court she asks where Herman is. He is in the cellar drawing wine
for his guests. She asks again for Herman as the company sits down
to table, and the answer is, In the chamber, lying in a coffin. She
springs from the table and rushes to the chamber, seizing two golden
knives, one of which she plunges into her heart. In Bohemian <b>E</b>,
when the bride arrives at John the bridegroom's house, and asks where
he is, they tell her she had better go to bed till midnight. The moment
she touches John she springs out of bed, and cries, Dear people, why
have ye laid a living woman with a dead man? They stand, saying, What
shall we give her, a white cap or a green chaplet? "I have not deserved
the white (widow's) cap," she says; "I have deserved a green chaplet."
In Wendish <b>A</b>, when the bell first knolls, the bride asks, Where
is the bridegroom? and they answer, In the new chamber, putting on his
fine clothes. A second toll evokes a second inquiry; and they say he
is in the new room, putting on his sword. The third time they conceal
nothing: He fell off his horse and broke his neck. "Then tear off my
fine clothes and dress me in white, that I may mourn a year and a
day, and go to church in a green chaplet, and never forget him that
loved me!" It will be remembered that the bride takes her own life in
Norwegian <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, and in Swedish <b>E</b>, as she
does in Bohemian <b>A b</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>.</p>

Grundtvig, No 37, the woman who has been carried off to the hill,

evidently gets, however, only the villar-konn, elvar-konn, of Landstad,
Nos 42-45, which are of lethean property. But in J. og D. <b>F</b>, we
may infer an atter-corn, though none is mentioned, from the effect of

<p><a name="Footnote_1_354" id="Footnote_1_354"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_354"><span class="label">[354]</span></a> Grundtvig remarks that Herder's translation, 'Erlkönigs
Tochter,' Volkslieder, II, 158, took so well with the Germans that at
last it came to pass for an original German ballad. The Wunderhorn, I,
261, ed. 1806, gives it with the title, 'Herr Olof,' as from a flying
sheet (== Scherer's Deutsche Volkslieder, 1851, p. 371). It appears,
with some little changes, in Zarnack's Deutsche Volkslieder, 1819, I,
29, whence it passed into Erlach, IV, 6, and Richter und Marschner, p.
60. Kretzschmer has the translation, again, with a variation here and
there, set to a "North German" and to a "Westphalian" air, p. 8, p. 9.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_355" id="Footnote_1_355"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_355"><span class="label">[355]</span></a> Owing to a close resemblance of circumstances in 'The
Elf-shot,' in 'Frillens Hævn' ('The Leman's Wreak'), Grundtvig, No 208,
and in 'Ribold og Guldborg,' Grundtvig, No 82, these ballads naturally
have details in common. The pretence that the horse was not sure-footed
and hurtled his rider against a tree; the request to mother, father,
etc., to make the bed, take care of the horse, apply a bandage, send
for a priest, etc.; the testament, the assignment of the bride by the
dying man to his brother, and her declaration that she will never
give her troth to two brothers; and the nearly simultaneous death of
hero, bride, and mother, occur in many versions of both Elveskud and
Ribold, and most of them in Frillens Hævn. A little Danish ballad, 'Hr.
Olufs Død,' cited by Grundtvig, IV, 847, seems to be Elveskud with the
elf-shot omitted.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_356" id="Footnote_1_356"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_356"><span class="label">[356]</span></a> Luzel was in possession of other versions, but he
assures us that every detail is contained in one or the other of these
three.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

me my weight in silver;" <i>then</i>, "or die in three days," etc. It is
not impossible that this stanza, entirely out of place in this ballad,
was derived from 'Le Comte des Chapelles,' Luzel, p. 457, from which
certain French versions have taken a part of their story. See Luzel,
the eighth and ninth stanzas, on p. 461.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_358" id="Footnote_1_358"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_358"><span class="label">[358]</span></a> <b>B</b> 50, "A white gown, or <i>broget</i>, or my violet
petticoat?" Luzel says he does not understand <i>broget</i>, and in his
Observations, prefixed to the volume, expresses a conjecture that it
must have been altered from <i>droged</i>, robe d'enfant, robe de femme,
but we evidently want a color. Grundtvig remarks that <i>broget</i> would
make sense in Danish, where it means party-colored. Scotch <i>broakit</i>
is black and white. Icelandic <i>brók</i>, tartan, party-colored cloth, is
said to be from Gaelic <i>breac</i>, versicolor (Vigfusson). This points to
a suitable meaning for Breton <i>broget</i>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_360" id="Footnote_1_360"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_360"><span class="label">[360]</span></a> It will be observed that some of the Renaud ballads
in the Poésies populaires de la France were derived from earlier
publications: such as were communicated by collectors appear to
have been sent in in 1852 or 1853. The versions cited by Rathery,
Revue Critique, II, 287 ff, are all from the MS. Poésies populaires.
<b>BB</b>, <b>CC</b> have either been overlooked by me in turning over
the first five volumes, or occur in vol. vi, which has not yet been

<p><a name="Footnote_1_361" id="Footnote_1_361"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_361"><span class="label">[361]</span></a> In <b>C</b> the mother-in-law tells her daughter,

<p>
So <b>E</b>, nearly. A mother makes a like remark to the betrothed of
a dead son in the Danish ballad of 'Ebbe Tygesen,' Grundtvig, Danske
Kæmpeviser og Folkesange, fornyede i gammel Stil, 1867, p. 122, st. 14.

<p>
The burial of father, mother, and child in a common grave is found

Romania, XI, 391 (a variety of 'Rizzardo bello,' Wolf, Volkslieder aus
Venetien, p. 62, No 83), appears to me not to belong with 'Renaud,'
but with the class of 'The Cruel Brother,' as already remarked of the
Venetian ballad at p. 142.</p></div>

<p>A song of 'Brume, brume on hil' is one of those named in The Complaint
of Scotland, 1549, p. 64 of Dr J. A. H. Murray's edition. "The foot of
the song" is sung, with others, by Moros in Wager's "very merry and
pithy Comedy called The longer thou livest the more fool thou art,"
c. 1568. 'Broom, broom on hil' is also one of Captain Cox's "bunch of
ballets and songs, all auncient," No 53 of the collection, 1575.<a name="FNanchor_1_366" id="FNanchor_1_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a>
The lines that Moros sings are:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Brome, brome on hill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gentle brome on hill, hill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brome, brome on Hive hill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gentle brome on Hive hill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The brome stands on Hive hill <b>a</b>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"A more sanguine antiquary than the editor," says Scott, "might perhaps
endeavor to identify this poem, which is of undoubted antiquity, with
the 'Broom, broom on hill' mentioned ... as forming part of Captain
Cox's collection." Assuredly "Broom, broom on hill," if that were
all, would justify no such identification, but the occurrence of Hive
hill, both in the burden which Moros sings and in the eighth stanza
of Scott's ballad, is a circumstance that would embolden even a very
cautious antiquary, if he had received Hive hill from tradition, and
was therefore unaffected by a suspicion that this locality had been
introduced by an editor from the old song.<a name="FNanchor_1_367" id="FNanchor_1_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a></p>

<p>Most of the versions give no explicit account of the knight's prolonged
sleep. He must needs be asleep when the lady comes to him, else there
would be no story; but his heavy slumber, not broken by all the efforts
of his horse and his hawk, is as a matter of course not natural; es
geht nicht zu mit rechten dingen; the witch-wife of <b>A</b> 4 is at
the bottom of that. And yet the broom-flowers strewed on his hals-bane
in <b>A</b> 8, <b>B</b> 3, and the roses in <b>D</b> 6, are only to
be a sign that the maid had been there and was gone. Considering the
character of many of Buchan's versions, we cannot feel sure that
<b>C</b> has not borrowed the second and third stanzas from <b>B</b>,
and the witch-wife, in the sixth, from <b>A</b>; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-391" id="Pg_1-391">[Pg 391]</a></span> it would be
extravagant to call in question the genuineness of <b>C</b> as a whole.
The eighth stanza gives us the light which we require.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Ye'll pu the bloom frae aff the broom,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Strew't at his head and feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And aye the thicker that ye do strew,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The sounder he will sleep.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The silver belt about the knight's head in <b>A</b> 5 can hardly have
to do with his sleeping, and to me seems meaningless. It is possible
that roses are not used at random in <b>D</b> 6, though, like the posie
of pleasant perfume in <b>F</b> 9, they serve only to prove that the
lady had been there. An excrescence on the dog-rose, rosenschwamm,
schlafkunz, kunz, schlafapfel, it is believed in Germany, if laid under
a man's pillow, will make him sleep till it is taken away. Grimm,
Deutsche Mythologie, p. 1008, and Deutsches Wörterbuch (Hildebrand), V,
2753 <i>e</i>.</p>

<p><b>C</b> makes the lady hide in the broom to hear what the knight
will say when he wakes, and in this point agrees with the broadside
<b>F</b>, as also in the comment made by the men on their master in
stanza 24; cf. <b>F</b> 16.</p>

<p>Mr J. W. Dixon has reprinted an Aldermary Churchyard copy of the
broadside, differing as to four or five words only from <b>F</b>, in
Ancient Poems, Ballads, and Songs of the Peasantry of England, p.
116, Percy Society, Volume XVII. The editor remarks that <b>A</b> is

buckishness of the broadside does not necessarily make an impression.

<p>The sleep which is produced in <b>A</b> by strewing the flower of
the broom on a man's head and feet, according to a witch's advice,
is brought about in two Norse ballads by means not simply occult,
but altogether preternatural; that is, by the power of runes. One of
these, 'Sömn-runorna,' Arwidsson, II, 249, No 133, is preserved in
a manuscript of the end of the seventeenth, or the beginning of the
eighteenth, century. The other, 'Sövnerunerne,' Grundtvig, II, 337, No
81, was taken down in 1847 from the singing of a woman seventy-five
years of age.</p>

<p>The Swedish ballad runs thus. There is a damsel in our land who every
night will sleep with a man, and dance a maid in the morning. The fame
of this comes to the ears of the son of the king of England, who orders
his horse, thinking to catch this damsel. When he arrives at the castle
gate, there stands the lady, and asks him what is his haste. He frankly
answers that he expects to get a fair maid's honor for his pains, and
she bids him follow her to the upper room. She lays sheets on the bed,
and writes strong runes on them. The youth sits down on the bed, and is
asleep before he can stretch himself out. He sleeps through that day,
and the next, and into the third. Then the lady rouses him. "Wake up;
you are sleeping your two eyes out." He is still so heavy that he can
hardly stir. He offers her his horse and saddle to report the matter as
he wishes. "Keep your horse," she says; "shame fa such liars."</p>

<p>The Danish story is much the same. One of a king's five sons goes to
make trial of the maid. She tells him to fasten his horse while she
goes before and unlocks; calls to her maid to bring five feather-beds,
feather-beds nine, and write a sleep on each of them. He sleeps through
three days, and is roused the fourth, with "Wake up, wake up; you have
slept away your pluck." He offers her a bribe, as before, which she
scornfully rejects, assuring him that he will not be spared when she
comes among maids and knights.</p>

<p>A sleep produced by runes or gramarye is one of the two main incidents
of a tale in the Gesta Romanorum, better known through the other, which
is the forfeit of flesh for money not forthcoming at the day set, as in
the Merchant of Venice: Latin, Oesterley, No 195, p. 603;<a name="FNanchor_1_369" id="FNanchor_1_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> English,
Harleian MS. 7333, No 40, printed by Douce, Illustrations of Shakspere,
I, 281, Madden, p. 130, Herrtage, p. 158; German, No 68, of the printed
edition of 1489 (which I have not seen). A knight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-392" id="Pg_1-392">[Pg 392]</a></span> who has a passion
for an emperor's daughter, engages to give a thousand [hundred] marks
for being once admitted to her bed. He instantly falls asleep, and has
to be roused in the morning. Like terms are made for a second night,
and the man's lands have to be pledged to raise the money. He sleeps
as before, but stipulates for a third night at the same price. A
merchant lends him the thousand marks, on condition that, if he breaks
his day, his creditor may take the money's weight of flesh from his
body. Feeling what a risk he is now running, the knight consults a
philosopher, Virgil, in the English version. The philosopher (who in
the Latin version says he ought to know, for he had helped the lady to
her trick) tells the knight that between the sheet and coverlet of the
bed there is a letter, which causes the sleep; this he must find, and,
when found, cast far from the bed. The knight follows these directions,
and gets the better of the lady, who conceives a reciprocal passion for
him, and delivers him, in the sequel, from the fearful penalty of his
bond by pleading that the flesh must be taken without shedding of blood.</p>

<p>The romance of Dolopathos, a variety of the Seven Wise Masters, written
about 1185, considerably before the earliest date which has hitherto
been proposed for the compilation of the Gesta, has this story, with
variations, of which only these require to be noted. The lady has
herself been a student in magic. She is wooed of many; all comers are
received, and pay a hundred marks; any one who accomplishes his will
may wed her the next day. An enchanted feather of a screech-owl, laid
under the pillow, makes all who enter the bed fall asleep at once,
and many have been baffled by this charm. At last a youth of high
birth, but small means, tries his fortune, and, failing at the first
essay, tries once more. Thinking that the softness of his couch was
the cause of his falling asleep, he puts away the pillow, and in this
process the feather is thrown out: Iohannis de Alta Silva Dolopathos,
ed. Oesterley, pp 57-59; Herbers, Li Romans de Dolopathos, Brunet et
Montaiglon, vv 7096-7498, pp 244-59; Le Roux de Lincy, in a sequel
to Loiseleur-Deslongchamps's Essai sur les Fables indiennes, pp 211
ff. This form of the tale is found in German, in a fifteenth-century
manuscript, from which it was printed by Haupt in Altdeutsche Blätter,
I, 143-49; but here the sleep is produced by the use of <i>both</i> the
means employed in the Gesta and in Dolopathos, letter (runes) and
feather, "the wild man's feather."<a name="FNanchor_1_370" id="FNanchor_1_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a></p>

<p>Magic is dropped, and a sleeping draught administered, just as the
man is going to bed, in a version of the story in the Pecorone of Ser
Giovanni Fiorentino, Giornata, IV<sup>a</sup>, Nov. 1_{a} (last quarter of the
fourteenth century). Upon the third trial the man, warned by a friendly
chambermaid not to drink, pours the medicated wine into his bosom. The
account of Ser Giovanni is adopted in Les Adventures d'Abdalla fils
d'Hanif, etc., La Haye, 1713, Bibliothèque de Romans, 1778, Janvier, I,
112-14, 143 f.</p>

<p>Ellin writes sleep-runes on the cushions on which her husband is to
sleep, in the Danish ballad 'Frændehævn,' Grundtvig, No 4, <b>A</b> 33
[<b>C</b> 45].</p>

<p>In Icelandic tales a sleep-thorn<a name="FNanchor_1_371" id="FNanchor_1_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> is employed, probably a thorn
inscribed with runes. The thorn is stuck into the clothes or into the
head (the ears, according to the popular notion, Vigfusson), and the
sleep lasts till the thorn is taken out. Odin stuck such a thorn into
Brynhild's garments: Fáfnismál, 43; Sigrdrífumál, 7; Völsúnga Saga,
Fornaldar Sögur, I, 166. The thorn is put into the clothes also in
the Icelandic fairy-tale, Mærþöll, Maurer, Isländische Volkssagen,
p. 286. Ólöf, to save herself from Helgi's violence, and to punish
his insolence, sticks him with a sleep-thorn after he is dead drunk:
Hrólfs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-393" id="Pg_1-393">[Pg 393]</a></span> Saga Kraka, Forn. S. I, 18f, Torfæus, p. 32. Vilhjálmr sticks a
sleep-thorn into Hrólfr, and he lies as if dead so long as the thorn is
in him: Gaungu-Hrólfs Saga, Forn. S., III, 303, 306.</p>

<p>A pillow of soporific quality, which Kamele, by Isot's direction, puts
under Kaedin's head, assures her safety though she lies all night by
his side: Ulrich's continuation of Gottfried's Tristan, vv 1668-99,
1744-85; and Heinrich's continuation, omitting the last circumstance,
vv 4861-4960 (J. Grimm).</p>

<p>The witch-woman, in the English ballad, <b>A</b> 4, represents the
philosopher in the Gesta, and the wager in the other versions the fee
or fine exacted by the lady in the Gesta and elsewhere.</p>

<p>An Italian ballad, a slight and unmeritable thing, follows the story of
Ser Giovanni, or agrees with it, in respect to the sleeping-draught. A
man falls in with a girl at a spring, and offers her a hundred ducats,
or scudi, per una nottina. The girl says that she must consult her
mother. The mother advises her to accept the offer: she will give the
man a drug, and the money will serve for a dowry. The man, roused in
the morning, counts out the money with one hand and wipes his eyes
with the other. When asked why he is crying, he replies that the money
is not the loss he weeps for, and makes a second offer of the same
amount. The girl wishes to refer the matter to her mother again, but
the gallant says the mother shall not take him in a second time. One
version (<b>A</b>) ends somewhat more respectably: the girl declares
that, having come off with her honor once, she will not again expose
herself to shame. <b>A.</b> Ferraro, Canti popolari monferrini, 'La

<p>'The Sleepy Merchant,' a modern ballad, in Kinloch's MSS, V, 26,
was perhaps fashioned on some traditional report of the story in Il
Pecorone. The girl gives the merchant a drink, and when the sun is up
starts to her feet, crying, "I'm a leal maiden yet!" The merchant comes
back, and gets another dram, but "tooms it a' between the bolster and
the wa," and then sits up and sings.</p>

<p>A ballad found everywhere in Germany, but always in what appears to be
an extremely defective form, must originally, one would think, have had
some connection with those which we are considering. A hunter meets
a girl on the heath, and takes her with him to his hut, where they
pass the night. She rouses him in the morning, and proclaims herself
still a maid. The hunter is so chagrined that he is of a mind to kill
her, but spares her life. 'Der Jäger,' 'Der ernsthafte Jäger,' 'Des

THE TWA MAGICIANS</h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, I, 24; Motherwell's
MS., p. 570.</p></div>


<p>A base-born cousin of a pretty ballad known over all Southern Europe,
and elsewhere, and in especially graceful forms in France.</p>

<p>The French ballad generally begins with a young man's announcing that
he has won a mistress, and intends to pay her a visit on Sunday, or to
give her an <i>aubade</i>. She declines his visit, or his music. To avoid
him she will turn, e. g., into a rose; then he will turn bee, and kiss
her. She will turn quail; he sportsman, and bag her. She will turn
carp; he angler, and catch her. She will turn hare; and he hound. She
will turn nun;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-400" id="Pg_1-400">[Pg 400]</a></span> he priest, and confess her day and night. She will fall
sick; he will watch with her, or be her doctor. She will become a star;
he a cloud, and muffle her. She will die; he will turn earth, into
which they will put her, or St Peter, and receive her into Paradise.
In the end she says, Since you are inevitable, you may as well have me
as another; or more complaisantly, Je me donnerai à toi, puisque tu
m'aimes tant.</p>

<p>This ballad might probably be found anywhere in France, but most of
the known versions are from south of the Loire. <b>A.</b> Romania, X,
390, E. Legrand, from Normandy; also known in Champagne. <b>B.</b> 'Les

Transformaciones,' Milá, Romancerillo Catalan, p. 393, No 513.</p>

<p><b>Italian.</b> Reduced to a <i>rispetto</i>, Tigri, Canti popolari toscani,
ed. 1860, p. 241, No 861.</p>

<p><b>Roumanian.</b> 'Cucul si Turturica,' Alecsandri, Poesi&#277; populare
ale Românilor, p. 7, No 3; French version, by the same, Ballades et
Chants populaires, p. 35, No 7; Schuller, Romänische Volkslieder, p.
47. The cuckoo, or the lover under that style, asks the dove to be his
mistress till Sunday. The dove, for his sake, would not say No, but
because of his mother, who is a witch, if not let alone will change
into a roll, and hide under the ashes. Then he will turn into a shovel,
and get her out. She will turn into a reed, and hide in the pond. He
will come as shepherd to find a reed for a flute, put her to his lips,
and cover her with kisses. She will change to an image, and hide in the
depths of the church. He will come every day in the week, as deacon
or chorister, to kiss the images (a pious usage in those parts), and
she will not thus escape him. Schuller refers to another version, in
Schuster's unprinted collection, in which youth and maid carry on this
contest in their proper persons, and not under figure.</p>

<p><b>Ladin.</b> Flugi, Die Volkslieder des Engadin, p. 83, No 12. "Who is
the younker that goes a-field ere dawn? Who is his love?" "A maid all
too fair, with dowry small enough." "Maid, wilt give me a rose?" "No;
my father has forbidden." "Wilt be my love?" "Rather a seed, and hide
in the earth." "Then I will be a bird, and pick thee out," etc.</p>

<p><b>Greek.</b> Tommaseo, III, 61, Passow, p. 431, No 574a. A girl tells
her mother she will kill herself rather than accept the Turk: she will
turn swallow, and take to the woods. The mother replies, Turn what you
will, he will turn hunter, and take you from me. The same kernel of
this ballad of transformations in Comparetti, Saggi dei Dialetti greci
dell' Italia meridionale, p. 38, No 36, as M. Paul Meyer has remarked,
Revue Critique, II, 302.</p>

<p>The ballad is well known to the Slavic nations.</p>

<p><b>Moravian.</b> &#268;elakovský, p. 75, No 6, Wenzig, Slawische
Volkslieder, p. 72, Bibliothek slavischer Poesien, p. 92. A youth
threatens to carry off a maid for his wife. She will fly to the wood
as a dove. He has a rifle that will bring her down. She will jump into
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-401" id="Pg_1-401">[Pg 401]</a></span> water as a fish. He has a net that will take the fish. She will
turn to a hare; he to a dog; she cannot escape him.</p>

<p><b>Polish.</b> Very common. <b>A a.</b> Wac&#322;aw z Oleska, p. 417, No
287; Konopka, p. 124. A young man says, though he should ride night and
day for it, ride his horse's eyes out, the maid must be his. She will
turn to a bird, and take to the thicket. But carpenters have axes which
can fell a wood. Then she will be a fish, and take to the water. But
fishermen have nets which will find her. Then she will become a wild
duck, and swim on the lake. Sportsmen have rifles to shoot ducks. Then
she will be a star in the sky, and give light to the people. He has
a feeling for the poor, and will bring the star down to the earth by
his prayers. "I see," she says, "it's God's ordinance; whithersoever I
betake myself, you are up with me; I will be yours after all." Nearly
the same mutations in other versions, with some variety of introduction
and arrangement. <b>A b.</b> Kolberg, Lud, VI, 129, No 257. <b>A c.</b>
"Przyjaciel ludu, 1836, rok 2, No 34;" Lipi&#324;ski, p. 135; Kolberg,

<b>J. a, b.</b> Roger, p. 147, No 285, p. 148, No 286.</p>

<p><b>Servian.</b> Karadshitch, I, 434, No 602; Talvj, II, 100; Kapper,
II, 208; Pellegrini, p. 37. Rather than be her lover's, the maid will
turn into a gold-jug in a drinking-house; he will be mine host. She
will change into a cup in a coffee-house; he will be <i>cafetier</i>. She
will become a quail, he a sportsman; a fish, he a net. Pellegrini has
still another form, 'La fanciulla assediata,' p. 93. An old man desires
a maid. She will rather turn into a lamb; he will turn into a wolf. She
will become a quail; he a hawk. She will change into a rose; he into a
goat, and tear off the rose from the tree.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt that these ballads are derived, or take their
hint, from popular tales, in which (1) a youth and maid, pursued by a
sorcerer, fiend, giant, ogre, are transformed by the magical powers
of one or the other into such shapes as enable them to elude, and
finally to escape, apprehension; or (2) a young fellow, who has been
apprenticed to a sorcerer, fiend, etc., and has acquired the black
art by surreptitious reading in his master's books, being pursued, as
before, assumes a variety of forms, and his master others, adapted to
the destruction of his intended victim, until the tables are turned
by the fugitive's taking on the stronger figure and despatching his
adversary.</p>

<p>Specimens of the first kind are afforded by Gonzenbach, Sicilianische
Märchen, Nos 14, 15, 54, 55; Grimms, Nos 51, 56, 113; Schneller, No 27;
Pitrè, Fiabe, Novelle e Racconti siciliani, No 15; Imbriani, Novellaja
milanese, No 27, N. fiorentana, No 29; Maspons y Labrós, Rondallayre,
I, 85, II, 30; Cosquin, Contes lorrains, in Romania, V, 354; Ralston's
Russian Folk-Tales, p. 129 f, from Afanasief V, No 23; Bechstein,
Märchenbuch, p. 75, ed. 1879, which combines both. Others in Köhler's
note to Gonzenbach, No 14, at II, 214.</p>

<p>Of the second kind, among very many, are Straparola, viii, 5, see
Grimms, III, 288, Louveau et Larivey, II, 152; Grimms, Nos 68, 117;
Müllenhoff, No 27, p. 466; Pröhle, Märchen für die Jugend, No 26;
Asbjørnsen og Moe, No 57; Grundtvig, Gamle danske Minder, 1854, Nos
255, 256; Hahn, Griechische Märchen, No 68; the Breton tale Koadalan,
Luzel, in Revue Celtique, I, 106/107; the Schotts, Walachische Mærchen,
No 18;<a name="FNanchor_1_374" id="FNanchor_1_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> Woicicki, Klechdy, II, 26, No 4; Karadshitch, No 6;
Afanasief, V, 95 f, No 22, VI,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-402" id="Pg_1-402">[Pg 402]</a></span> 189 ff, No 45 a, b, and other Russian
and Little Russian versions, VIII, 340. Köhler adds several examples
of one kind or the other in a note to Koadalan, Revue Celtique, I,
132, and Wollner Slavic parallels in a note to Leskien und Brugman,
Litanische Volkslieder und Märchen, p. 537 f.</p>

<p>The usual course of events in these last is that the prentice takes
refuge in one of many pomegranate kernels, barley-corns, poppy-seeds,
millet-grains, pearls; the master becomes a cock, hen, sparrow, and
picks up all of these but one, which turns into a fox, dog, weasel,
crow, cat, hawk, vulture, that kills the bird.</p>

<p>The same story occurs in the Turkish Forty Viziers, Behrnauer, p. 195
ff, the last transformations being millet, cock, man, who tears off
the cock's head. Also in the introduction to Siddhi-Kür, Jülg, pp 1-3,
where there are seven masters instead of one, and the final changes are
worms, instead of seeds, seven hens, a man with a cane who kills the
hens.<a name="FNanchor_1_375" id="FNanchor_1_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a></p>

<p>The pomegranate and cock (found in Straparola) are among the
metamorphoses in the contest between the afrite and the princess in the
tale of the Second Calender in the Arabian Nights.</p>

<p>Entirely similar is the pursuit of Gwion the pigmy by the goddess
Koridgwen, cited by Villemarqué, Barzaz Breiz, p. lvi, ed. 1867, from
the Myvyrian Archaiology of Wales, I, 17. Gwion having, by an accident,
come to the knowledge of superhuman mysteries, Koridgwen wishes to take
his life. He flees, and turns successively into a hare, fish, bird;
she follows, in the form of hound, otter, hawk; finally he becomes a
wheaten grain, she a hen, and swallows the grain.</p>

<p>The ordinary tale has found its way into rhyme in a German broadside
ballad, Longard, Altrheinländische Mährlein und Liedlein, p. 76, No
40, 'Von einem gottlosen Zauberer und seiner unschuldigen Kindlein
wunderbarer Erlösung.' The two children of an ungodly magician, a boy
and a girl, are devoted by him to the devil. The boy had read in his
father's books while his father was away. They flee, and are pursued:
the girl becomes a pond, the boy a fish. The wicked wizard goes for
a net. The boy pronounces a spell, by which the girl is turned into
a chapel, and he into an image on the altar. The wizard, unable to
get at the image, goes for fire. The boy changes the girl into a
threshing-floor, himself into a barley-corn. The wizard becomes a hen,
and is about to swallow the grain of barley. By another spell the boy
changes himself into a fox, and then twists the hen's neck.</p>

of Weland. That little trait comes, no doubt, from Weland's story; but

KING JOHN AND THE BISHOP</h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><b><a href="#Version_45_B">B</a>.</b> 'King John and the Abbot of Canterbury,' broadside
printed for P. Brooksby.</p></div>


<p>The broadside <b>B</b> was printed, with trifling variations, or
corrections, in Pills to purge Melancholy, IV, 29 (1719), and in Old
Ballads, II, 49 (1723). It is found in several of the collections:
Pepys, II, 128, No 112; Roxburghe, III, 883; Ouvry, No 47; the Bagford;
and it was among Heber's ballads. Brooksby published from 1672 to
1695, and <b>B</b> was "allowed" by Roger l'Estrange, who was licenser
from 1663 to 1685: Chappell, The Roxburghe Ballads, I, xviii, xxiii.
The title of <b>B</b> is A <i>new</i> ballad of King John and the Abbot of
Canterbury, to the tune of 'The King and the Lord Abbot.'<a name="FNanchor_1_376" id="FNanchor_1_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> This
older ballad seems not to have come down.</p>

<p>There are at least two other broadsides ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-404" id="Pg_1-404">[Pg 404]</a></span>tant upon the same subject,
both mentioned by Percy, and both inferior even to <b>B</b>, and in a
far less popular style: 'The King and the Bishop,' Pepys, I, 472, No
243, Roxburghe, III, 170, Douce, fol. 110; and 'The Old Abbot and King
Olfrey,' Douce, II, fol. 169, Pepys, II, 127, No 111, printed in Old
Ballads, II, 55.<a name="FNanchor_1_377" id="FNanchor_1_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> In both of these the Shepherd is the Bishop's
brother, which he is not in <b>B</b>; in <b>A</b> he is half-brother.
Pepys's Penny Merriments contain, I, 14, 'The pleasant History of King
Henry the Eighth and the Abbot of Reading.'<a name="FNanchor_1_378" id="FNanchor_1_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> This last may, without
rashness, be assumed to be a variation of 'King John and the Abbot.'</p>

<p>Percy admitted 'King John and the Abbot' to his Reliques, II, 302,
introducing many lines from <b>A</b> "worth reviving," and many
improvements of his own,<a name="FNanchor_1_379" id="FNanchor_1_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> and thus making undeniably a very good
ballad out of a very poor one.</p>

<p>The story of this ballad was told in Scotland, some fifty years ago,
of the Gudeman of Ballengeigh, James the V, the hero of not a few
other tales. Once on a time, falling in with the priest of Markinch
(near Falkland), and finding him a dullard, he gave the poor man four
questions to think of till they next met, with an intimation that his
benefice would be lost were they not rightly answered. The questions
were those of our ballad, preceded by Where is the middle of the earth?
The parson could make nothing of them, and was forced to resort to
a miller of the neighborhood, who was reputed a clever fellow. When
called to answer the first question, the miller put out his staff, and
said, There, as your majesty will find by measuring. The others were
dealt with as in the ballad. The king said that the miller should have
the parson's place, but the miller begged off from this in favor of the
incumbent. Small, Interesting Roman Antiquities recently discovered in
Fife, p. 289 ff.</p>

<p>Riddle stories in which a forfeit is to be paid by a vanquished party
have incidentally been referred to under No 1 and No 2. They are a very
extensive class. The oldest example is that of Samson's riddle, with
a stake of thirty sheets (or shirts) and thirty change of garments:
Judges, xiv, 12 ff. Another from Semitic tradition is what is related
of Solomon and Hiram of Tyre, in Josephus against Apion, i, 17, 18, and
Antiquities, viii, 5. After the manner of Amasis and the Æthiopian king
in Plutarch (see p. 13), they send one another riddles, with a heavy
fine for failure,&mdash;in this case a pecuniary one. Solomon at first poses
Hiram; then Hiram guesses Solomon's riddles, by the aid of Abdemon (or
the son of Abdemon), and in turn poses Solomon with riddles devised by
Abdemon.<a name="FNanchor_1_380" id="FNanchor_1_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a></p>

<p>'Pá grönaliðheiði,' Landstad, p. 369, is a contest in riddles between
two brothers (refreshingly original in some parts), introduced by three
stanzas, in which it is agreed that the defeated party shall forfeit
his share of their inheritance: and this the editor seems to take quite
seriously.</p>

<p>Death is the penalty attending defeat in many of these wit-contests.
Odin (Vafþrúðnismál), jealous of the giant Vafþrúðnir's wisdom, wishes
to put it to test. He enters the giant's hall, assuming the name of
Gagn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-405" id="Pg_1-405">[Pg 405]</a></span>ráðr, and announces the object of his visit. The giant tells him
he shall never go out again unless he prove the wiser, asks a few
questions to see whether he be worth contending with, and, finding him
so, proposes a decisive trial, with their heads for the stake. Odin
now propounds, first, twelve questions, mostly in cosmogony, and then
five relating to the future of the universe; and all these the giant is
perfectly competent to answer. The very unfair question is then put,
What did Odin say in his son's ear ere Balder mounted the funeral pile?
Upon this Vafþrûðnir owns himself vanquished, and we may be sure he was
not spared by his antagonist.</p>

<p>The Hervarar saga contains a story which, in its outlines, approximates
to that of our ballad until we come to the conclusion, where there is
no likeness. King Heiðrekr, after a long career of blood, gave up war
and took to law-making. He chose his twelve wisest men for judges,
and swore, with one hand on the head and the other on the bristles
of a huge hog which he had reared, that no man should do such things
that he should not get justice from these twelve, while any one who
preferred might clear himself by giving the king riddles which he could
not guess. There was a man named Gestr, and surnamed the Blind, a very
bad and troublesome fellow, who had withheld from Heiðrekr tribute
that was due. The king sent him word to come to him and submit to the
judgment of the twelve: if he did not, the case would be tried with
arms. Neither of these courses pleased Gestr, who was conscious of
being very guilty: he took the resolution of making offerings to Odin
for help. One night there was a knock. Gestr went to the door, and saw
a man, who announced his name as Gestr. After mutual inquiries about
the news, the stranger asked whether Gestr the Blind was not in trouble
about something. Gestr the Blind explained his plight fully, and the
stranger said, "I will go to the king and try what I can effect: we
will exchange looks and clothes." The stranger, in the guise of Gestr,
entered the king's hall, and said, Sire, I am come to make my peace.
"Will you abide by the judgment of my men of law?" asked the king. "Are
there not other ways?" inquired Gestr. "Yes: you shall give me riddles
which I cannot guess, and so purchase your peace." Gestr assented,
with feigned hesitation; chairs were brought, and everybody looked to
hear something fine. Gestr gave, and Heiðrekr promptly answered, some
thirty riddles.<a name="FNanchor_1_381" id="FNanchor_1_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> Then said Gestr: Tell thou me this only, since
thou thinkest to be wiser than all kings: What said Odin in Balder's
ear before he was borne to the pile? "Shame and cowardice," exclaimed
Heiðrekr, "and all manner of poltroonery, jugglery, goblinry! no one
knows those words of thine save thou thyself, evil and wretched wight!"
So saying, Heiðrekr drew Tyrfing, that never was bared but somebody
must fall, to cut down Gestr. The disguised Odin changed to a hawk, and
made for the window, but did not escape before Heiðrekr's sword had
docked the bird's tail. For breaking his own truce Odin said Heiðrekr
should die by the hand of a slave, which came to pass. Fornaldar Sögur,
Rafn, I, 462 ff.</p>

<p>The same story has come down in a Färöe ballad, 'Gátu ríma,'
Hammershaimb, Færöiske Kvæder, No 4, p. 26 (and previously published in
the Antiquarisk Tidsskrift, 1849-51, pp 75-78), translated by Dr Prior,
I, 336 ff. Gest promises Odin twelve gold marks to take his place. The
riddles are announced as thirteen in number, but the ballad is slightly
defective, and among others the last question, What were Odin's words
to Balder? is lost. Odin flies off in the shape of a falcon; Hejdrek
and all his men are burned up.</p>

<p>A tale presenting the essential traits of our ballad is cited in
Vincent of Beauvais's Speculum Morale, i, 4, 10, at the end. We read,
he says, of a king, who, seeking a handle for wrenching money out of a
wealthy and wise man, put him three questions, apparently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-406" id="Pg_1-406">[Pg 406]</a></span> insoluble,
intending to make him pay a large sum for not answering them: 1, Where
is the middle point of the earth? 2, How much water is there in the
sea? 3, How great is the mercy of God? On the appointed day, having
been brought from prison into the presence to ransom himself if he
could, the respondent, by the <i>advice of a certain philosopher</i>,
proceeded thus. He planted his staff where he stood, and said, Here is
the centre; disprove it if you can. If you wish me to measure the sea,
stop the rivers, so that nothing may flow in till I have done; then
I will give you the contents. To answer your third question, I must
borrow your robes and your throne. Then mounting the throne, clothed
with the royal insignia, "Behold," said he, "the height of the mercy
of God: but now I was a slave, now I am a king; but now poor, and now
rich; but now in prison and in chains, and now at liberty," etc.</p>

<p>Of the same stamp is a story in the English Gesta Romanorum, Madden,
p. 55, No 19. A knight was accused to the emperor by his enemies, but
not so as to give a plausible ground for steps against him. The emperor
could hit upon no way but to put him questions, on pain of life and
death. The questions were seven; the third and the sixth will suffice:
How many gallons of salt water been in the sea? Answer: Let all the
outpassings of fresh water be stopped, and I shall tell thee. How many
days' journey beth in the circle of the world? Answer: Only the space
of one day.</p>

<p>Much nearer to the ballad, and earlier than either of the preceding, is
the Stricker's tale of Âmîs and the Bishop, in the Pfaffe Âmîs, dated
at about 1236. Âmîs, a learned and bountiful priest in England, excited
the envy of his bishop, who sent for him, told him that he lived in
better style than his superior, and demanded a subvention. The priest
flatly refused to give the bishop anything but a good dinner. "Then
you shall lose your church," said the bishop in wrath. But the priest,
strong in a good conscience, felt small concern about that: he said the
bishop might test his fitness with any examination he pleased. That I
will do, said the bishop, and gave him five questions. "How much is
there in the sea?" "One tun," answered Âmîs; "and if you think I am
not right, stop all the rivers that flow in, and I will measure it and
convince you." "Let the rivers run," said the bishop. "How many days
from Adam to our time?" "Seven," said the parson; "for as soon as seven
are gone, they begin again." The bishop, fast losing his temper, next
demanded "What is the exact middle of the earth? Tell me, or lose your
church." "Why, my church stands on it," replied Âmîs. "Let your men
measure, and take the church if it prove not so." The bishop declined
the task, and asked once more: How far is it from earth to sky? and
then: What is the width of the sky? to which Âmîs replied after the
same fashion.</p>

<p>In this tale of the Stricker the parson answers for himself, and not
by deputy, and none of the questions are those of our ballad. But in
a tale of Franco Sacchetti,<a name="FNanchor_1_382" id="FNanchor_1_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> given in two forms, Novella iv<sup>a</sup>, we
have both the abbot and his humble representative, and an agreement as
to one of the questions. Bernabò Visconti (&dagger; 1385) was offended with
a rich abbot, who had neglected some dogs that had been entrusted to
his care, and was minded to make the abbot pay him a fine; but so far
yielded to the abbot's protest as to promise to release him from all
penalties if he could answer four questions: How far is it from here to
heaven? How much water is there in the sea? What is going on in hell?
What is the value of my person? A day was given to get up the answers.
The abbot went home, in the depths of melancholy, and met on the way
one of his millers, who inquired what was the matter, and, after
receiving an explanation, offered to take the abbot's place, disguising
himself as well as he could. The answers to the two first questions are
not the usual ones: huge numbers are given, and the seigneur is told
to measure for himself, if not willing to accept them. The answer to
the fourth is twenty-nine deniers; for our Lord was sold for thirty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-407" id="Pg_1-407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
and you must be worth one less than he. Messer Bernabò said the miller
should be abbot, and the abbot miller, from that time forth. Sacchetti
says that others tell the story of a pope and an abbot, adding one
question. The gardener of the monastery presents the abbot, makes the
usual answer to the second question as to the water in the sea, and
prizes Christ's vicar at twenty-eight deniers.</p>

<p>The excellent old farce, "Ein Spil von einem Kaiser und eim Apt,"
Fastnachtspiele aus dem 15<sup>n</sup> Jahrhundert, I, 199, No 22, obliges the
abbot to answer three questions, or pay for all the damages done in the
course of a calamitous invasion. The abbot has a week's grace allowed
him. The questions are three: How much water in the sea? How much is
the emperor worth? Whose luck came quickest? The miller answers for
the abbot: Three tubs, if they are big enough; eight and twenty pence;
and <i>he</i> is the man whose luck came quickest, for just before he was a
miller, now he is an abbot. The emperor says that, since the miller has
acted for the abbot, abbot he shall be.</p>

<p>Very like this, as to the form of the story, is the anecdote in Pauli's
Schimpf und Ernst, LV, p. 46, ed. Oesterley (c. 1522). A nobleman, who
is seeking an occasion to quarrel with an abbot, tells him that he must
answer these questions in three days, or be deposed: What do you value
me at? Where is the middle of the world? How far apart are good and bad
luck? A swineherd answers for him: Since Christ was sold for thirty
pence, I rate the emperor at twenty-nine and you at twenty-eight; my
church is the mid-point of the world, and, if you will not believe
me, measure for yourself; good and bad luck are but one night apart,
for yesterday I was a swineherd, to-day I am an abbot. Then, says the
nobleman, an abbot shall you stay. With this agrees, say the Grimms,
the tale in Eyring's Proverbiorum Copia (1601), I, 165-168, III, 23-25.</p>

<p>Waldis, Esopus (1548), B. 3, Fabel 92, Kurz, I, 382, agrees in general
with Pauli: but in place of the first two questions has these three:
How far is to heaven? How deep is the sea? How many tubs will hold
all the sea-water? The answers are: A short day's journey, for Christ
ascended in the morning and was in heaven before night; a stone's cast;
one tub, if large enough.</p>

<p>Teofilo Folengo (1491-1544), as pointed out by Köhler, has the story in
the 8th canto of his Orlandino; and here we find the third question of
our ballad. There are three besides: How far from earth to heaven? From
the east to the west?&mdash;a modification of the second question in the
ballad; How many drops of water in the seas about Italy? The abbot's
cook, Marcolf, answers to the first, One leap, as proved by Satan's
fall; to the second, One day's journey, if the sun is to be trusted;
and insists that, for a correct count under the third, all the rivers
shall first be stopped. To the fourth he makes the never-stale reply,
You <i>think</i> I am the abbot, but I am the cook. Rainero says he shall
remain abbot, and the abbot the cook. (Stanzas 38, 39, 64-69, pp 186 f,
195 ff, London edition of 1775.)</p>

<p>A capital Spanish story, 'Gramatica Parda, Trueba, Cuentos Populares,
p. 287, has all three of the questions asked and answered as in our
ballad. There is a curate who sets up to know everything, and the king,
"el rey que rabió," has found him out, and gives him a month to make
his three answers, with a premium and a penalty. The curate is forced
to call in a despised goatherd, who also had all along seen through the
shallowness of the priest. The king makes the goatherd "archipámpano"
of Seville, and condemns the curate to wear the herdsman's garb and
tend his goats for a month.<a name="FNanchor_1_383" id="FNanchor_1_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a></p>

<p>The first and third questions of the ballad are found in the
thirty-eighth tale of Le Grand Parangon des Nouvelles Nouvelles of
Nicolas de Troyes, 1536 (ed. Mabille, p. 155 ff); in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-408" id="Pg_1-408">[Pg 408]</a></span> the Patrañuelo of
Juan de Timoneda, 1576, Pat. 14, Novelistas anteriores á Cervantes, in
the Rivadeneyra Biblioteca, p. 154 f; and in the Herzog Heinrich Julius
von Braunschweig's comedy, Von einem Edelman welcher einem Abt drey
Fragen auffgegeben, 1594, ed. Holland, p. 500 ff. The other question
is as to the centre of the earth, and the usual answers are given by
the abbot's miller, cook, servant, except that in Timoneda the cook is
so rational as to say that the centre must be under the king's feet,
seeing that the world is as round as a ball.<a name="FNanchor_1_384" id="FNanchor_1_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> The question Where
is the middle of the earth? is replaced by How many stars are there
in the sky? the other two remaining, in Balthasar Schupp, Schriften,
Franckfurt, 1701, I, 91 f (Köhler), and in Gottlieb Cober (&dagger; 1717),
Cabinet-prediger, 2<sup>r</sup> Theil, No 65, p. 323 (Gräter, Idunna u. Hermode,
1814, No 33, p. 131, and p. 87). The abbot's miller gives a huge
number, and bids the king (of France) verify it, if he wishes. This
last is no doubt the version of the story referred to by the Grimms in
their note to K. u. H. märchen, No 152.</p>

<p>We encounter a slight variation, not for the better, in L'Élite des
Contes du Sieur d'Ouville (&dagger; 1656 or 1657), Rouen, 1699, I, 241; à
la Haye, 1703, I, 296; ed. Ristelhuber, 1876, p. 46 (Köhler); Nouveaux
Contes à Rire, Cologne, 1709, p. 266; Contes à Rire, Paris, 1781, I,
184. An ignorant and violent nobleman threatens a parson, who plumes
himself on a little astrology, that he will expose him as an impostor
if he does not answer four questions: Where is the middle of the world?
What am I worth? What am I thinking? What do I believe? The village
miller answers for the curé. The reply to the third question is,
You are thinking more of your own interest than of mine; the others
as before. This story is retold, after tradition, by Cénac Moncaut,
Contes populaires de la Gascogne, p. 50, of a marquis, archiprêtre, and
miller. The query, What am I thinking of? with the answer, More of your
interest than of mine (which is not exactly in the popular manner), is
replaced by a logical puzzle, not found elsewhere: Quel est le nombre
qui se trouve renfermé dans deux [oeufs]?</p>

<p>The King and the Abbot is preserved, in modern German tradition, in
this form. An emperor, riding by a cloister, reads the inscription,
We are two farthings poorer than the emperor, and live free of cares.
Wait a bit, says the emperor, and I will give you some cares. He sends
for the abbot, and says, Answer these three questions in three days,
or I will depose you. The questions are, How deep is the sea? How many
stars in the sky? How far from good luck to bad? The shepherd of the
monastery gives the answers, and is told, as in several cases before,
If you are the abbot, abbot you shall be. J. W. Wolf, Hessische Sagen,
p. 166, No 262, II. 'Gustav Adolf und der Abt von Benediktbeuern,' in
Sepp's Altbayerischer Sagenschatz, p. 554, No 153, is another form of
the same story, with a substitution of How far is it to heaven? for
the first question, and the answers are given by a kitchie-boy.<a name="FNanchor_1_385" id="FNanchor_1_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a>
In 'Hans ohne Sorgen,' Meier, Deutsche Volksmärchen aus Schwaben, p.
305, the questions are, How far is it to heaven? How deep is the sea?
How many leaves has a linden? and the shepherd again undertakes the
answers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-409" id="Pg_1-409">[Pg 409]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_1_386" id="FNanchor_1_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> 'Der Müller ohne Sorgen,' Müllenhoff, p. 153, 208, is a
mutilated variation of these. The abbot disappears, and the questions
are put to the miller, who answers for himself. The second question is
How much does the moon weigh? and the answer, Four quarters; if you
don't believe it, you must weigh for yourself.</p>

<p>We meet the miller <i>sans souci</i> again in a Danish tale, which otherwise
agrees entirely with our ballad. The questions are answered by the rich
miller's herdsman: Grundtvig, Gamle danske Minder, 1854, p. 112, No 111.</p>

<p>A Croatian version of the story is given by Valyavets, 'Frater i turski
car,' p. 262. The Turkish tsar is disposed to expel all monks from
his dominions, but determines first to send for an abbot to try his
calibre. The abbot is too much frightened to go, and his cook, as in
Foligno and Timoneda, takes his place. The questions are, Where is
the centre of the world? What is God doing now? What am I thinking?
The first and third are disposed of in the usual way. When called to
answer the second, the cook said, You can't see through the ceiling: we
must go out into the field. When they came to the field, the cook said
again, How can I see when I am on such a small ass? Let me have your
horse. The sultan consented to exchange beasts, and then the cook said,
God is wondering that a sultan should be sitting on an ass and a monk
on a horse. The sultan was pleased with the answers, and reasoning,
If the cook is so clever, what must the abbot be, decided to let the
monks alone. Afanasief, who cites this story from Valyavets (Narodnuiya
russkiya Skazki, VIII, 460), says that he heard in the government
of Voroneje a story of a soldier who dressed himself as a monk and
presented himself before a tsar who was in the habit of puzzling people
with riddles. The questions are, How many drops in the sea? How many
stars in the sky? What do I think? And the answer to the last is, Thou
thinkest, gosudar, that I am a monk, but I am merely a soldier.<a name="FNanchor_1_387" id="FNanchor_1_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a></p>

<p>A few tales, out of many remaining, may be now briefly mentioned, on
account of variations in the setting.</p>

<p>A prisoner is to be released if he can tell a queen how much she is
worth, the centre of the world, and what she thinks. A peasant changes
clothes with the prisoner, and answers <i>pro more</i>. Kurtzweiliger
Zeitvertreiber durch C. A. M. von W., 1668, p. 70 f, in Köhler, Orient
u. Occident, I, 43.</p>

<p>A scholar has done learning. His master says he must now answer three
questions, or have his head taken off. The master's brother, a miller,
comes to his aid. The questions are, How many ladders would reach to
the sky? Where is the middle of the world? What is the world worth? Or,
according to another tradition, the two last are, How long will it take
to go round the world? What is my thought? Campbell, Popular Tales of
the West Highlands, II, 391 f.</p>

<p>Eulenspiegel went to Prague, and advertised himself on the doors of
the churches and lecture-rooms as a great master, capable of answering
questions that nobody else could solve. To put him down, the rector
and his colleagues summoned Eulenspiegel to an examination before the
university. Five questions were given him: How much water is there in
the sea? How many days from Adam to now? Where is the middle of the
world? How far from earth to heaven? What is the breadth of the sky?
Lappenberg, Dr Thomas Murners Ulenspiegel, p. 38, No 28; Howleglas, ed.
Ouvry, p. 28.</p>

<p>A herdboy had a great fame for his shrewd answers. The king did not
believe in him, but sent for him, and said, If you can answer three
questions that I shall put, I will regard you as my own child, and you
shall live<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-410" id="Pg_1-410">[Pg 410]</a></span> in my palace. The questions are, How many drops of water
are there in the ocean? How many stars in the sky? How many seconds in
eternity? The Grimms, K. u. H. märchen, No 152, 'Das Hirtenbüblein.'</p>

<p>Three questions are put to a counsellor of the king's, of which the
first two are, Where does the sun rise? How far from heaven to earth?
The answers, by a shepherd, are extraordinarily feeble. Jüdisches
Maasäbuch, cap. 126, cited from Helwigs Jüdische Historien, No 39, in
the Grimms' note to Das Hirtenbüblein.</p>

<p>Three monks, who know everything, in the course of their travels come
to a sultan's dominions, and he invites them to turn Mussulmans. This
they agree to do if he will answer their questions. All the sultan's
doctors are convened, but can do nothing with the monks' questions. The
hodja (the court-fool) is sent for. The first question, Where is the
middle of the earth? is answered as usual. The second monk asks, How
many stars are there in the sky? The answer is, As many as there are
hairs on my ass. Have you counted? ask the monks. Have <i>you</i> counted?
rejoins the fool. Answer me this, says the same monk, and we shall see
if your number is right: How many hairs are there in my beard? "As many
as in my ass's tail." "Prove it." "My dear man, if you don't believe
me, count yourself; or we will pull all the hairs out of both, count
them, and settle the matter." The monks submit, and become Mussulmans.
Les plaisanteries de Nasr-eddin Hodja, traduites du turc par J. A.
Decourdemanche, No 70, p. 59 ff.</p>

<p>The Turkish emperor sends word to Kaiser Leopold that unless the
emperor can answer three questions he shall come down upon him with
all his Turks. The counsellors are summoned, but there is no help in
them. The court-fool offers to get his master out of the difficulty,
if he may have the loan of crown and sceptre. When the fool comes to
Constantinople, there lies the sultan in the window, and calls out,
Are you the emperor, and will you answer my questions? Where does the
world end? "Here, where my horse is standing." How far is it to heaven?
"One day's journey, and no inn on the road." What is God thinking of
now? "He is thinking that I am one fool and you another." J. W. Wolf,
Hessische Sagen, p. 165, No 262I.<a name="FNanchor_1_388" id="FNanchor_1_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a></p>

an older source an anecdote of a king insisting upon being told how
much he ought to bring if offered for sale. While his courtiers are
giving flattering replies, a fool leaps forward and says, Twenty-nine
deniers, and no more; for if you were worth thirty, that would be
autant que le tout-puissant Dieu valut, quant il fut vendu. The king
took this answer to heart, and repented of his vanities. So an emperor
is converted by this reply from a man-at-arms, Van den verwenden
Keyser, Jan van Hollant, c. 1400, Willems, Belgisch Museum, X, 57;
Thijm, p. 145. The like question and answer, as a riddle, in a German

<p><a name="Footnote_1_386" id="Footnote_1_386"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_386"><span class="label">[386]</span></a> Another Swabian story, in Meier, No 28, p. 99, is a
mixed form. The Duke of Swabia reads "Hans sans cares" over a miller's
house-door, and says, "Bide a wee: if you have no cares, I will give
you some." The duke, to give the miller a taste of what care is, says
he must solve this riddle or lose his mill: Come to me neither by
day nor by night, neither naked nor clothed, neither on foot nor on
horseback. The miller promises his man his daughter in marriage and the
mill in succession, if he will help him out of his dilemma. The man at
once says, Go on Mid-week, for Mid-week is no day (Mitt-woch ist ja gar
kein Tag, wie Sonn-tag, Mon-tag), neither is it night; and if you are
to be neither clothed nor bare, put on a fishing-net; and if you are
to go neither on foot nor on horseback, ride to him on an ass. All but
the beginning of this is derived from the cycle of 'The Clever Wench:'
see No 2. Haltrich, Deutsche Volksmärchen in Siebenbürgen, No 45, which
is also of this cycle, has taken up a little of 'Hans ohne Sorgen.' A
church has an inscription, Wir leben ohne Sorgen. This vexes the king,
who says as before, Just wait, and I will give you reason for cares, p.
244, ed. 1856.</p></div>

Wedderburn' was equally in vogue in the north and the south of Scotland.</p>

<p>Jamieson writes to the Scots Magazine, 1803, p. 701: "Of this ballad
I have got one whole copy and part of another, and I remember a good
deal of it as I have heard it sung in Morayshire when I was a child."
In his Popular Ballads, II, 154, 1806, he says that the copy which he
prints was furnished him from Mr Herd's MS. by the editor of the Border
Minstrelsy, and that he had himself supplied a few readings of small
importance from his own recollection. There is some inaccuracy here.
The version given by Jamieson is rather <b>B</b>, with readings from

<p>'Captain Wedderburn's Courtship,' or 'Lord Roslin's Daughter,'<a name="FNanchor_1_392" id="FNanchor_1_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a>
is a counterpart of the ballad in which a maid wins a husband by
guessing riddles. (See Nos 1 and 2, and also the following ballad,
for a lady who <i>gives</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-416" id="Pg_1-416">[Pg 416]</a></span> riddles.) The ingenious suitor, though not
so favorite a subject as the clever maid, may boast that he is of an
old and celebrated family. We find him in the Gesta Romanorum, No 70;
Oesterley, p. 383, Madden's English Versions, No 35, p. 384. A king had
a beautiful daughter, whom he wished to dispose of in marriage; but she
had made a vow that she would accept no husband who had not achieved
three tasks: to tell her how many feet long, broad, and deep were the
four elements; to change the wind from the north; to take fire into his
bosom, next the flesh, without harm. The king issued a proclamation in
accordance with these terms. Many tried and failed, but at last there
came a soldier who succeeded. To answer the first question he made his
servant lie down, and measured him from head to foot. Every living
being is composed of the four elements, he said, and I find not more
than seven feet in them. A very easy way was hit on for performing the
second task: the soldier simply turned his horse's head to the east,
and, since wind is the life of every animal, maintained that he had
changed the wind. The king was evidently not inclined to be strict, and
said, Clear enough. Let us go on to the third. Then, by the aid of a
stone which he always carried about him, the soldier put handfuls of
burning coals into his bosom without injury. The king gave his daughter
to the soldier.</p>

<p>An extraordinary ballad in Sakellarios's [Greek: <i>Kypriaka</i>] III, 15,
No 6, 'The Hundred Sayings,' subjects a lover to a severe probation of
riddles. (Liebrecht has given a full abstract of the story in Gosche's
Archiv, II, 29.) A youth is madly enamored of a king's daughter, but,
though his devotion knows no bound, cannot for a long time get a word
from her mouth, and then only disdain. She shuts herself up in a tower.
He prays for a heat that may force her to come to the window, and that
she may drop her spindle, and he be the only one to bring it to her.
The heavens are kind: all this comes to pass, and she is fain to beg
him to bring her the spindle. She asks, Can you do what I say? Shoulder
a tower? make a stack of eggs? trim a date-tree, standing in a great
river?<a name="FNanchor_1_393" id="FNanchor_1_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> All this he can do. She sends him away once and again to
learn various things; last of all, the hundred sayings that lovers use.
He presents himself for examination. "One?" "There is one only God: may
he help me!" "Two?" "Two doves with silver wings are sporting together:
I saw how they kissed," etc. "Three?" "Holy Trinity, help me to love
the maid!" "Four?" "There is a four-pointed cross on thy smock, and it
implores God I may be thy mate:" and so he is catechised through all
the units and tens.<a name="FNanchor_1_394" id="FNanchor_1_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> Then the lady suddenly turns about, concedes
everything, and proposes that they shall go to church: but the man
says, If I am to marry all my loves, I have one in every town, and wife
and children in Constantinople. They part with reciprocal scurrilities.</p>

<p>Usually when the hand of a princess is to be won by the performance
of tasks, whether requiring wit, courage, the overcoming of magic
arts, or what not, the loss of your head is the penalty of failure.
(See the preface to the following ballad.) Apollonius of Tyre, of
Greek original, but first found in a Latin form, is perhaps the
oldest riddle-story of this description. Though its age has not been
determined, the tale has been carried back even to the end of the third
or the beginning of the fourth century, was a great favorite with the
Middle Ages, and is kept only too familiar by the play of Pericles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-417" id="Pg_1-417">[Pg 417]</a></span></p>

<p>More deserving of perpetuation is the charming Persian story of Prince
Calaf, in Pétis de La Croix's 1001 Days (45<sup>e</sup>-82<sup>e</sup> jour), upon which
Carlo Gozzi founded his play of "La Turandot," now best known through
Schiller's translation. Tourandocte's riddles are such as we should
call legitimate, and are three in number. "What is the being that is
found in every land, is dear to all the world, and cannot endure a
fellow?" Calaf answers, The sun. "What mother swallows the children she
has given birth to, as soon as they have attained their growth?" The
sea, says Calaf, for the rivers that flow into it all came from it.
"What is the tree that has all its leaves white on one side and black
on the other?" This tree, Calaf answers, is the year, which is made up
of days and nights.<a name="FNanchor_1_395" id="FNanchor_1_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a></p>

<p>A third example of this hazardous wooing is the story of The Fair One
of the Castle, the fourth in the Persian poem of The Seven Figures
(or Beauties), by Nisami of Gendsch (&dagger; 1180). A Russian princess is
shut up in a castle made inaccessible by a talisman, and every suitor
must satisfy four conditions: he must be a man of honor, vanquish
the enchanted guards, take away the talisman, and obtain the consent
of her father. Many had essayed their fortune, and their heads were
now arrayed on the pinnacles of the castle.<a name="FNanchor_1_396" id="FNanchor_1_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> A young prince
had fulfilled the first three conditions, but the father would not
approve his suit until he had solved the princess's riddles. These are
expressed symbolically, and answered in the same way. The princess
sends the prince two pearls from her earring: he at once takes her
meaning,&mdash;life is like two drops of water,&mdash;and returns the pearls with
three diamonds, to signify that joy&mdash;faith, hope, and love&mdash;can prolong
life. The princess now sends him three jewels in a box, with sugar. The
prince seizes the idea,&mdash;life is blended with sensuous desire,&mdash;and
pours milk on the sugar, to intimate that as milk dissolves sugar, so
sensuous desire is quenched by true love. After four such interchanges,
the princess seals her consent with a device not less elegant than the
others.<a name="FNanchor_1_397" id="FNanchor_1_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a></p>

<p>A popular tale of this class is current in Russia, with this variation:
that the hard-hearted princess requires her lovers to give her riddles,
and those who cannot pose her lose their heads. Foolish Iván, the
youngest of three brothers, adventures after many have failed. On his
way to the trial he sees a horse in a cornfield and drives it out with
a whip, and further on kills a snake with a lance, saying in each case,
Here's a riddle! Confronted with the princess, he says to her, As I
came to you, I saw by the roadside what was good; and in the good was
good; so I set to work, and with what was good I drove the good from
the good. The good fled from the good out of the good. The princess
pleads a headache, and puts off her answer till the next day, when
Iván gives her his second enigma: As I came to you, I saw on the way
what was bad, and I struck the bad with a bad thing, and of what was
bad the bad died. The princess, unable to solve these puzzles, is
obliged to accept foolish Iván. (Afanasief, Skazki, II, 225 ff, No 20,
in Ralston's Songs of the Russian People, p. 354 f.) Closely related
to this tale, and still nearer to one another, are the Grimms' No 22,
'Das Räthsel' (see, also, the note in their third volume), and the
West Highland story, 'The Ridere (Knight) of Riddles,' Campbell, No
22, II, 27. In the former, as in the Russian tale, it is the princess
that must be puzzled before she will yield her hand; in the latter, an
unmatchable beauty is to be had by no man who does not put a question
which her father cannot solve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-418" id="Pg_1-418">[Pg 418]</a></span></p>

<p>Here may be put three drolleries, all clearly of the same origin,
in which a fool wins a princess by nonplussing her: 'The Three
Questions,' Halliwell's Popular Rhymes and Nursery Tales, p. 32; a
"schwank" of the fourteenth century, by Heinz der Kellner, von der
Hagen's Gesammtabenteuer, No 63, III, 179 (there very improperly called
Turandot); 'Spurningen,' Asbjørnson og Moe, Norske Folkeeventyr, No 4,
Dasent, Popular Tales from the Norse, p. 148. According to the first of
these, the king of the East Angles promises his clever daughter to any
one who can answer three of her questions (in the other versions, more
correctly, <i>silence</i> her). Three brothers, one of them a natural, set
out for the court, and, on the way, Jack finds successively an egg, a
crooked hazel-stick, and a nut, and each time explodes with laughter.
When they are ushered into the presence, Jack bawls out, What a troop
of fair ladies! "Yes," says the princess, "we are fair ladies, for we
carry fire in our bosoms." "Then roast me an egg," says Jack, pulling
out the egg from his pocket. "How will you get it out again?" asks the
princess? "With a crooked stick," says Jack, producing the same. "Where
did that come from?" says the princess. "From a nut," answers Jack,
pulling out the nut. And so, as the princess is silenced, the fool gets
her in marriage.<a name="FNanchor_1_398" id="FNanchor_1_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a></p>

<p>Even nowadays riddles play a noteworthy part in the marriages of
Russian peasants. In the government Pskof, as we are informed by
Khudyakof, the bridegroom's party is not admitted into the bride's
house until all the riddles given by the party of the bride have been
answered; whence the saying or proverb, to the behoof of bridegrooms,
Choose comrades that can guess riddles. In the village of Davshina, in
the Yaroslav government, the bridegroom's best man presents himself at
the bride's house on the wedding-day, and finding a man, called the
bride-seller, sitting by the bride, asks him to surrender the bride and
vacate his place. "Fair and softly," answers the seller; "you will not
get the bride for nothing; make us a bid, if you will. And how will you
trade? will you pay in riddles or in gold?" If the best man is prepared
for the emergency, as we must suppose he always would be, he answers,
I will pay in riddles. Half a dozen or more riddles are now put by the
seller, of which these are favorable specimens: Give me the sea, full
to the brim, and with a bottom of silver. The best man makes no answer
in words, but fills a bowl with beer and lays a coin at the bottom.
Tell me the thing, naked itself, which has a shift over its bosom.
The best man hands the seller a candle. Finally the seller says, Give
me something which the master of this house lacks. The best man then
brings in the bridegroom. The seller gives up his seat, and hands the
best man a plate, saying, Put in this what all pretty girls like. The
best man puts in what money he thinks proper, the bridesmaids take it
and quit the house, and the bridegroom's friends carry off the bride.</p>

<p>So, apparently in some ballad, a maid gives riddles, and will marry
only the man who will guess them.</p>

<p>In Radloff's Songs and Tales of the Turkish tribes in East Siberia, I,
60, a father, wanting a wife for his son, applies to another man, who
has a marriageable daughter. The latter will not make a match unless
the young man's father will come to him with pelt and sans pelt, by the
road and not by the road, on a horse and yet not on a horse: see 8 ff
of this volume. The young man gives his father proper instructions, and
wins his wife.</p>

<p>A Lithuanian mother sends her daughter to the wood to fetch "winter May
and sum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-419" id="Pg_1-419">[Pg 419]</a></span>mer snow." She meets a herdsman, and asks where she can find
these. The herdsman offers to teach her these riddles in return for her
love, and she complying with these terms, gives her the answers: The
evergreen tree is winter May, and sea-foam is summer snow. Beiträge zur
Kunde Preussens, I, 515 (Rhesa), and Ausland, 1839, p. 1230.</p>

<p>The European tales, excepting the three drolleries (and even they
are perhaps to be regarded only as parodies of the others), must be
of Oriental derivation; but the far north presents us with a similar
story in the lay of Alvíss, in the elder Edda. The dwarf Alvíss comes
to claim Freya for his bride by virtue of a promise from the gods.
Thor<a name="FNanchor_1_400" id="FNanchor_1_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> says that the bride is in his charge, and that he was from
home when the promise was made: at any rate, Alvíss shall not have the
maid unless he can answer all the questions that shall be put him. Thor
then requires Alvíss to give him the names of earth, heaven, moon, sun,
etc., ending with barley and the poor creature small beer, in all the
worlds; that is, in the dialect of the gods, of mankind, giants, elves,
dwarfs, etc. Alvíss does this with such completeness as to extort
Thor's admiration, but is craftily detained in so doing till after
sunrise, when Thor cries, You are taken in! Above ground at dawn! and
the dwarf turns to stone.</p>

their turning the course of rivers; bringing them the salamander,
the basilisk, the graal, Paris's apple; giving them a sight of Enoch
and Elijah in the body, a hearing of the sirens, etc. Von der Hagen,
Minnesinger, II, 91 f, 385 f.</p></div>

distinguished family of the Sinclairs of Roslin to furnish one for this
ballad. I see two mentioned among the Sinclairs of Herdmanstoun. Even
a Wedderburn connection, as I am informed, is not absolutely lacking.

See Köhler in Orient u. Occident, II, 558-9. A dragon, in Hahn's
Griechische u. Albanesische Märchen, II, 210, gives Penteklimas ten of
these number-riddles: if he answers them he is to have a fine castle;
if not, he is to be eaten. An old woman answers for him: "One is God,
two are the righteous, etc.; ten is your own word, and now burst,
dragon!" The dragon bursts, and Penteklimas inherits his possessions.</p></div>

<p><b>A</b> was communicated to Scott "by Mr Hamilton, music-seller,
Edinburgh, with whose mother it had been a favorite." Two stanzas and
one line were wanting, and were supplied by Scott "from a different
ballad, having a plot somewhat similar." The stanzas were 6 and 9.
<b>C</b> was printed from the MS., with a few changes, under the title
of 'The Bonny Hind Squire,' by Dixon, in Scottish Traditional Versions
of Ancient Ballads, p. 42, and from Dixon in Bell's Early Ballads, p.
183. Christie, Traditional Ballad Airs, I, 28, says the ballad was
called 'Jolly Janet' by the old people in Aberdeenshire.</p>

<p><b>A-D</b> are plainly compounded of two ballads, the conclusion being
derived from <b>E</b>. The lady's looking oer her castle wa, her
putting riddles, and her having gard so mony die,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-426" id="Pg_1-426">[Pg 426]</a></span> make the supposition
far from incredible that the Proud Lady Margaret of the first part of
the ballad may originally have been one of the cruel princesses spoken
of in the preface to '<a href="#Ballad_46">Captain Wedderburn's Courtship</a>,' p. <a href="#Pg_1-417">417</a>. But the
corrupt condition of the texts of <b>A-D</b> forbids any confident
opinion.</p>

<p>A dead mistress similarly admonishes her lover, in a ballad from
Brittany, given in Ampère, Instructions relatives aux Poésies
populaires de la France, p. 36.</p>

449 f, 'La Concubine;' and Luzel, "Celui qui alla voir sa maitresse
en enfer," I, 44, 45. In this last, a lover, whose mistress has died,
goes into a monastery, where he prays continually that he may see her
again. The devil presents himself in the likeness of a young man, and
on condition of being something gently considered takes him to hell.
He sees his mistress sitting in a fiery chair (cf. <b>B</b>, 30, 31),
devoured by serpents night and day, and is informed that fasts and
masses on his part will only make things worse. Like Dives, she sends
word to her sister not to do as she has done. Some of these traits are
found also in one or another of the French versions.</p>

<br />
YOUNG ANDREW</h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Percy MS., p. 292. Hales and Furnivall, II, 328.</p></div>


<p>'Young Andrew' is known only from the Percy manuscript. The story
recalls both '<a href="#Ballad_4">Lady Isabel and the Elf-Knight</a>,' No 4, and '<a href="#Ballad_9">The Fair
Flower of Northumberland</a>,' No 9. The lady, Helen, 25<sup>3</sup>, is bidden to
take, and does take, gold with her in stanzas 5-7, as in No 4, English
<b>E</b> 2, 3, <b>D</b> 7, Danish <b>A</b> 12, <b>E</b> 7, 9, <b>I</b>
5, <b>L</b> 5, 6, and nearly all the Polish copies, and again in No 9,
<b>A</b> 14. She is stripped of her clothes and head-gear in 8-17, as
in No 4, English <b>C-E</b>, German <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>, and many of the
Polish versions. These are destined by Young Andrew for his lady ("that
dwells so far in a strange country") in 10, 12, 14, as by Ulinger for
his sister, and by Adelger for his mother, in German <b>G</b> 18,
<b>H</b> 15. In 15 the lady entreats Young Andrew to leave her her
smock; so in No 4, Polish <b>L</b> 8, "You brought me from home in a
green gown; take me back in a shift of tow," and <b>R</b> 13, "You took
me away in red satin; let me go back at least in a smock." 18 has the
choice between dying and going home again which is presented in 'Lady
Isabel,' Polish <b>AA</b> 4, <b>H</b> 10, <b>R</b> 11, and implied in
'The Fair Flower of Northumberland,' <b>D</b> 2-5; in <b>A</b> 25 of
this last the choice is between dying and being a paramour. In 20, 21,
the lady says, "If my father ever catches you, you're sure to flower a
gallows-tree," etc.; in No 4, Polish <b>J</b> 5, "If God would grant
me to reach the other bank, you know, wretch, what death you would
die." The father is unrelenting in this ballad, v. 26, and receives his
daughter with severity in 'The Fair Flower of Northumberland,' <b>B</b>
13, <b>C</b> 13. The conclusion of 'Young Andrew' is mutilated and hard
to make out. He seems to have been pursued and caught, as John is in
the Polish ballads, <b>O</b>, <b>P</b>, <b>T</b>, etc., of No 4. Why he
was not promptly disposed of, and how the wolf comes into the story,
will probably never be known.</p>

<p><b><a href="#Version_49_G">G</a>. a.</b> 'John and William,' taken down from the singing
of little girls in South Boston. <b>b.</b> From a child in New
York. Both communicated by Mr W. W. Newell.</p></div>


<p>All the Scottish versions were obtained within the first third of this
century, and since then no others have been heard of. It is interesting
to find the ballad still in the mouths of children in American
cities,&mdash;in the mouths of the poorest, whose heritage these old things
are.<a name="FNanchor_1_401" id="FNanchor_1_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> The American versions, though greatly damaged, preserve the
names John and William, which all the other copies have.</p>

<p><b>B</b> and <b>C</b> are considerably corrupted. It need hardly be
mentioned that the age of the boys in the first two stanzas of <b>B</b>
does not suit the story. According to <b>C</b> 8, 15, the mother had
cursed John, before he left home, with a wish that he might never
return; and in <b>C</b> 9, John sends word to his true-love that he is
in his grave for her dear sake alone. These points seem to have been
taken from some copy of 'Willie and May Margaret,' or 'The Drowned
Lovers.' The conclusion of both <b>B</b> and <b>C</b> belongs to 'Sweet
William's Ghost.' <b>C</b> 18 may be corrected by <b>B</b> 10, though
there is an absurd jumble of pipes and harp in the latter. The harp,
in a deft hand, effects like wonders in many a ballad: e. g., 'Harpens
Kraft,' Grundtvig, II, 65, No 40; even a pipe in <b>C</b> 14-16 of the
same.</p>

<p><b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>G</b> supplement the story with more
or less of the ballad of 'Edward:' see p. 168.</p>

<p>Jamieson inquires for this ballad in the Scots Magazine for October,
1803, p. 701, at which time he had only the first stanza and the first
half of the third. He fills out the imperfect stanza nearly as in the
copy which he afterwards printed:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But out an Willie's taen his knife,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And did his brother slay.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Of the five other Scottish versions, all except <b>B</b> make the
deadly wound to be the result of accident, and this is, in Motherwell's
view, a point essential. The other reading, he says, is at variance
with the rest of the story, and "sweeps away the deep impression this
simple ballad would otherwise have made upon the feelings: for it is
almost unnecessary to mention that its touching interest is made to
centre in the boundless sorrow and cureless remorse of him who had been
the unintentional cause of his brother's death, and in the solicitude
which that high-minded and generous spirit expresses, even in the last
agonies of nature, for the safety and fortunes of the truly wretched
and unhappy survivor." But the generosity of the dying man is plainly
greater if his brother has killed him in an outburst of passion; and
what is gained this way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-436" id="Pg_1-436">[Pg 436]</a></span> will fully offset the loss, if any, which
comes from the fratricide having cause for "cureless remorse" as well
as boundless sorrow. Motherwell's criticism, in fact, is not quite
intelligible. (Minstrelsy, p. 61.)</p>

<p>The variation in the story is the same as that between the English
'Cruel Brother' and the German 'Graf Friedrich:' in the former the
bride is killed by her offended brother; in the latter it is the
bridegroom's sword slipping from its sheath that inflicts the mortal
hurt.</p>

<p>Motherwell was inclined to believe, and Kirkpatrick Sharpe was
convinced, that this ballad was founded upon an event that happened
near Edinburgh as late as 1589, that of one of the Somervilles having
been killed by his brother's pistol accidentally going off. Sharpe
afterward found a case of a boy of thirteen killing a young brother
in anger at having his hair pulled. This most melancholy story, the
particulars of which are given in the last edition of the Ballad Book,
p. 130, note xix, dates nearly a hundred years later, 1682. Only the
briefest mention need be made of these unusually gratuitous surmises.</p>

<p>Kirkland, in <b>D</b>, was probably suggested by the kirkyard of other
versions, assisted, possibly, by a reminiscence of the Kirkley in
'Robin Hood's Death and Burial;' for it will be observed that stanzas
8, 9 of <b>D</b> come pretty near to those in which Robin Hood gives
direction for his grave; <b>F</b> 9, 10, <b>B</b> 5, 6 less near.<a name="FNanchor_1_402" id="FNanchor_1_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a></p>

<p>Cunningham has entitled a romance of his, upon the theme of 'The Two
Brothers' (which, once more, he ventures to print nearly in the state
in which he once had the pleasure of hearing it sung), 'Fair Annie of
Kirkland:' Songs of Scotland, II, 16.</p>

<p>The very pathetic passage in which the dying youth directs that father,
mother, and sister shall be kept in ignorance of his death, and then,
feeling how vain the attempt to conceal the fact from his true-love
will be, bids that she be informed that he is in his grave and will
never come back, is too truly a touch of nature to be found only here.
Something similar occurs in 'Mary Hamilton,' where, however, the
circumstances are very different:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'And here's to the jolly sailor lad<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That sails upon the faeme!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let not my father nor mother get wit<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But that I shall come again.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'And here's to the jolly sailor lad<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That sails upon the sea!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But let not my father nor mother get wit<br /></span>
<span class="i2">O the death that I maun dee.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In a fine Norse ballad (see 'Brown Robyn's Confession,' further on) a
man who is to be thrown overboard to save a ship takes his leave of the
world with these words:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'If any of you should get back to land,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And my foster-mother ask for me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tell her I'm serving in the king's court,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And living right merrily.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'If any of you should get back to land,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And my true-love ask for me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bid her to marry another man,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For I am under the sea.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A baron, who has been mortally wounded in a duel, gives this charge to
his servant:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Faites mes compliments à ma femme,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mais ne lui dites pas que j'ai été tué;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mais dites lui que je serai allé à Paris,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pour saluer le roi Louis.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Dites que je serai allé à Paris,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pour saluer le roi Louis,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>In like manner a dying klepht: "If our comrades ask about me, tell them
not that I have died: say only that I have married in strange lands;
have taken the flat stone for mother-in-law, the black earth for my
wife, the black worms for brothers-in-law." Zam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-437" id="Pg_1-437">[Pg 437]</a></span>belios, p. 606, No 11,
Fauriel, I, 51, Passow, p. 118, No 152; and again, Zambelios, p. 672,
No 94, Passow, p. 113, No 146. In the Danish 'Elveskud,' Grundtvig, II,
115, No 47, B* 18, Ole would simply have the tragic truth kept from his
bride:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Hearken, Sir Ole, of mickle pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How shall I answer thy young bride?'<br /></span>

<p>Such questions and answers as we have in <b>D</b> 20, <b>E</b> 17,
<b>F</b> 24, are of the commonest occurrence in popular poetry, and
not unknown to the poetry of art. Ballads of the '<a href="#Ballad_13">Edward</a>' class
end generally or always in this way: see p. <a href="#Pg_1-168">168</a>. We have again the
particular question and answer which occur here in '<a href="#Ballad_51">Lizie Wan</a>' and in
one version of 'The Trooper and Fair Maid,' Jamieson's Popular Ballads,
II, 158. The question may be: When will you come back? When shall you
cease to love me? When shall we be married? etc.; and the answer: When
apple-trees grow in the seas; when fishes fly and seas gang dry; when
all streams run together; when all swift streams are still; when it
snows roses and rains wine; when all grass is rue; when the nightingale
sings on the sea and the cuckoo is heard in winter; when poplars bear
cherries and oaks roses; when feathers sink and stones swim; when sand
sown on a stone germinates, etc., etc. See Virgil, Ecl. i, 59-63;

<br />
THE BONNY HIND</h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>'The Bonny Hyn,' Herd's MSS, I, 224; II, fol. 65, fol. 83.</p></div>


<p>This piece is transcribed three times in Herd's manuscripts, with a
note prefixed in each instance that it was copied from the mouth of
a milkmaid in 1771. An endorsement to the same effect on the last
transcript gives the date as 1787, no doubt by mistake. Scott had only
MS. I in his hands, which accidentally omits two stanzas (13, 14), and
he printed this defective copy with the omission of still another (4):
Minstrelsy, II, 298, ed. 1802; III, 309, ed. 1833. Motherwell supplies
these omitted stanzas, almost in Herd's very words, in the Introduction
to his collection, p. lxxxiv, note 99. He remarks, p. 189, that tales
of this kind abound in the traditionary poetry of Scotland. The two
ballads which follow, Nos <a href="#Ballad_51">51</a>, <a href="#Ballad_52">52</a>, are of the same general description.</p>

<p>In the first half of the story 'The Bonny Hind' comes very near to the
fine Scandinavian ballad of 'Margaret,' as yet known to be preserved
only in Färöe and Icelandic. The conclusions differ altogether.
Margaret in the Färöe ballad, 'Margretu kvæði,' Færöiske Kvæder,
Hammershaimb, No 18, is the only daughter of the Norwegian king Magnus,
and has been put in a convent. After two or three months she longs to
see her father's house again. On her way thither she is assaulted by a
young noble with extreme violence: to whom she says,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now you have torn off all my clothes, and done me sin and shame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I beg you, before God most high, tell me what is your name.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Magnus, he answers, is his father, and Gertrude his mother, and
he himself is Olaf, and was brought up in the woods. By this she
recognizes that he is her own brother. Olaf<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-445" id="Pg_1-445">[Pg 445]</a></span> begs her to go back to the
convent, and say nothing, bearing her sorrow as she may. This she does.
But every autumn the king makes a feast, and invites to it all the
nuns in the cloister. Margaret is missed, and asked for. Is she sick
or dead? Why does she not come to the feast, like other merry dames?
The wicked abbess answers, Your daughter is neither sick nor dead; she
goes with child, like other merry dames. The king rides off to the
cloister, encounters his daughter, and demands who is the father of her
child. She replies that she will sooner die than tell. The king leaves
her in wrath, but returns presently, resolved to burn the convent, and
Margaret in it, Olaf comes from the wood, tired and weary, sees the
cloister burning, and quenches the flames with his heart's blood.</p>

<p>The Icelandic ballad, 'Margrètar kvæði,' Íslenzk Fornkvæði, Grundtvig
and Sigurðsson, No 14, has the same story. It is, however, the man who
brings on the discovery by asking the woman's parentage. The editors
inform us that the same subject is treated in an unprinted Icelandic
ballad, less popular as to style and stanza, in the Arne Magnussen
collection, 154.</p>

<p>The story of Kullervo, incorporated in what is called the national
epic of the Finns, the Kalevala, has striking resemblances with the
ballads of the Bonny Hind class. While returning home in his sledge
from a somewhat distant errand, Kullervo met three times a girl who
was travelling on snow-shoes, and invited her to get in with him. She
rejected his invitation with fierceness, and the third time he pulled
her into the sledge by force. She angrily bade him let her go, or she
would dash the sledge to pieces; but he won her over by showing her
rich things. The next morning she asked what was his race and family;
for it seemed to her that he must come of a great line. "No," he said,
"neither of great nor small. I am Kalervo's unhappy son. Tell me of
what stock art thou." "Of neither great nor small," she answered. "I
am Kalervo's unhappy daughter." She was, in fact, a long-lost sister
of Kullervo's, who, when a child, had gone to the wood for berries,
and had never found her way home. She had wept the first day and the
second; the third and fourth, the fifth and sixth, she had tried every
way to kill herself. She broke out in heart-piercing lamentations:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'O that I had died then, wretched!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O that I had perished, weak one!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had not lived to hear these horrors,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had not lived this shame to suffer!'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>So saying she sprang from the sledge into the river, and found relief
under the waters.</p>

<p>Kullervo, mad with anguish, went home to his mother, and told her what
had happened. He asked only how he might die,&mdash;by wolf or bear, by
whale or sea-pike. His mother vainly sought to soothe him. He consented
to live only till the wrongs of his parents had been revenged. His
mother tried to dissuade him even from seeking a hero's death in fight.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'If thou die in battle, tell me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What protection shall remain then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the old age of thy father?'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Let him die in any alley,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay his life down in the house-yard.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'What protection shall remain then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the old age of thy mother?'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Let her die on any straw-truss;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let her stifle in the stable.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Who shall then be left thy brother,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who stand by him in mischances?'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Let him pine away in the forest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let him drop down on the common.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Who shall then be left thy sister,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who stand by her in mischances?'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'When she goes to the well for water,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or to the washing, let her stumble.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Kullervo had his fill of revenge. Meanwhile father, brother, sister,
and mother died, and he came back to his home to find it empty and
cold. A voice from his mother's grave seemed to direct him to go to the
wood for food: obeying it, he came again to the polluted spot, where
grass or flowers would not grow any more. He asked his sword would it
like to feed on guilty flesh and drink wicked blood. The sword said,
Why should I not like to feed on guilty flesh and drink wicked blood, I
that feed on the flesh of the good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-446" id="Pg_1-446">[Pg 446]</a></span> and drink the blood of the sinless?
Kullervo set the sword hilt in the earth, and threw himself on the
point. (Kalewala, übertragen von Schiefner, runes 35, 36.)</p>

<p>The dialogue between Kullervo and his mother is very like a passage
in another Finnish rune, 'Werinen Pojka,' 'The Bloody Son,' Schröter,
Finnische Runen, 124, ed. 1819; 150, ed. 1834. This last is a form
of the ballad known in Scottish as <a href="#Ballad_13">'Edward,' No 13</a>, or of <a href="#Ballad_49">'The Twa
Brothers,' No 49</a>. Something similar is found in <a href="#Ballad_51">'Lizie Wan,' No 51</a>.</p>

<p>The passage 5-7 is a commonplace that may be expected to recur under
the same or analogous circumstances, as it does in '<a href="#Version_39_D">Tam Lin,' <b>D</b></a>,
'The Knight and Shepherd's Daughter,' 'The Maid and the Magpie,' and in
one version of 'The Broom of Cowdenknows.' These are much less serious
ballads, and the tone of stanza 5, which so ill befits the distressful
situation, is perhaps owing to that stanza's having been transferred
from some copy of one of these. It might well change places with this,
from 'The Knight and Shepherd's Daughter,' <b>A</b>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Now, if you are a courteous knight,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Tell me what is your name.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Much better with the solemn adjuration in the Färöe 'Margaret,' or even
this in 'Ebbe Galt,' Danske Viser, No 63, 8:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

LIZIE WAN</h2>

<p><b><a href="#Version_51_A">A</a>. a.</b> 'Lizie Wan,' Herd's MSS, I, 151; II, 78. <b>b.</b>
Herd's Scottish Songs, 1776, I, 91.</p>

<p><b><a href="#Version_51_B">B</a>.</b> 'Rosie Ann,' Motherwell's MS., p. 398.</p></div>


<p><b>A</b>, first printed in Herd's Scottish Songs, ed. 1776, is here
given from his manuscript copy. <b>B</b> is now printed for the first
time.</p>

<p><b>A</b> is translated by Grundtvig, Engelske og Skotske Folkeviser,
No 50, who subjoins a Danish ballad, 'Liden Ellen og hendes Broder,'
of similar character. Of this the editor had three versions, differing
but little, and all of slight poetical value, and he prints one which
was committed to writing some sixty or seventy years ago, with some
readings from the others. Liden Jensen, having killed Liden Ellen in a
wood, pretends to his mother that she has gone off with some knights.
He is betrayed by blood on his clothes, confesses the truth, and is
condemned to be burned. 'Herr Axel,' Arwidsson's Swedish collection,
No 46, I, 308, under similar circumstances, kills Stolts Kirstin's two
children, is asked by his mother why his hands are bloody, pretends to
have slain a hind in the wood, and has his head struck off by order of
his father.</p>

<p>'Herr Peder og hans Söster,' an unpublished Danish ballad, of which
Grundtvig obtained a single traditional version, has also a slight
resemblance to 'Lizie Wan.' Kirsten invites<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-448" id="Pg_1-448">[Pg 448]</a></span> Sir Peter to her bed. He
declines for various reasons, which she refutes. She discovers him to
be her brother by her needle-work in his shirt. He draws his knife and
stabs her. "This was also a pitiful sight, the twin children playing in
the mother's bosom." Compare Kristensen, II, No 74 <b>A</b>, <b>D</b>,
<b>E</b>, at the end.</p>

<p>The conclusion, <b>A</b> 11-12, <b>B</b> 10-17, resembles that of '<a href="#Ballad_49">The
Twa Brothers</a>,' No 49, but is poetically much inferior.</p>

<p><b>B</b> is the ballad referred to, and partly cited, in Motherwell's
preface to 'The Broom blooms bonnie and says it is fair,' Minstrelsy,
p. 189. This copy has been extremely injured by tradition; so much so
as not to be intelligible in places except by comparison with <b>A</b>.
The act described in stanza 9 should be done by the king's daughter's
own hand; stanza 12 should be addressed by her to her sister; stanza 13
is composed of fragments of two. <b>C</b> and <b>D</b> have suffered
worse, for they have been corrupted and vulgarized.</p>

<p>At the beginning there is resemblance to '<a href="#Ballad_39">Tam Lin</a>' and to '<a href="#Ballad_41">Hind Etin</a>.'</p>

which succeeds it are given from copies taken from Mrs Brown's
recitation,<a name="FNanchor_1_403" id="FNanchor_1_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> collated with two other copies procured from Scotland;
one in MS.; another, very good, one printed for the stalls; a third,
in the possession of the late Reverend Jonathan Boucher, of Epsom,
taken from recitation in the north of England; and a fourth, about one
third as long as the others, which the editor picked off an old wall
in Piccadilly. <b>L</b>, the only English copy, was derived from the
singing of a London vagrant. It is, says Dixon, the common English
broadsheet "turned into the dialect of Cockaigne."<a name="FNanchor_1_404" id="FNanchor_1_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> <b>M</b> was
probably a broadside or stall copy, and is certainly of that quality,
but preserves a very ancient traditional feature.</p>

<p><b>D</b> and <b>M</b>, besides the name Linne, have in common a
repetition of the song, a trait which we also find in one version of
'The Heir of Linne;'<a name="FNanchor_1_405" id="FNanchor_1_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> see Dixon's Scottish Traditional Versions of
Ancient Ballads, p. 30, stanzas 2-6, Percy Society, vol. <span class="smcap">XVII</span>.</p>

<p>In Bell's Ancient Poems, Ballads, and Songs of the Peasantry of
England, p. 68, it is remarked that <b>L</b>, "the only ancient form
in which the ballad has existed in print," is one of the publications
mentioned in one of Thackeray's catalogues of broadsides. The
'Bateman,' in Thackeray's list, is the title of an entirely different
ballad, 'A Warning for Maidens, or Young Bateman,' reprinted from the
Roxburghe collection by W. Chappell, III, 193.</p>

<p>"Young Beichan" is a favorite ballad, and most deservedly. There are
beautiful repetitions of the story in the ballads of other nations, and
it has secondary affinities with the extensive cycle of '<a href="#Ballad_17">Hind Horn</a>,'
the parts of the principal actors in the one being inverted in the
other.</p>

<p>The hero's name is mostly Beichan, with slight modifications like
Bekie, <b>C</b>, Bicham, <b>A</b>, Brechin, <b>B</b>; in <b>L</b>,
Bateman; in <b>M</b>, Bondwell. The heroine is Susan Pye in ten of the
fourteen versions; Isbel in <b>C</b>; Essels, evidently a variety of
Isbel, in <b>M</b>, which has peculiar relations with <b>C</b>; Sophia
in <b>K</b>, <b>L</b>.</p>

<p>Beichan is London born in <b>A</b>, <b>D</b>, [<b>E</b>], <b>H</b>,
<b>I</b>, <b>N</b>, English born in <b>B</b>; London city is his own,
<b>A</b> 6, <b>B</b> 7, <b>F</b> 7, or he has a hall there, <b>I</b>
7, <b>N</b> 27 f.; half Northumberland belongs to him, <b>L</b>; he is
lord of the towers of Line, <b>D</b> 9, <b>C</b> 5, <b>M</b> 5, which
are in London, <b>D</b> 15 f, but are transferred by reciters to the
water of Tay, <b>M</b> 29, and to Glasgow, or the vicinity, <b>H</b>
20. <b>H</b>, though it starts with calling him London born, speaks of
him thereafter as a Scottish lord, 12, 18, 31.<a name="FNanchor_1_406" id="FNanchor_1_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a></p>

<p>Beichan has an Englishman's desire strange countries for to see,
<b>A</b>, <b>D</b>, [<b>E</b>], <b>I</b>, <b>L</b>, <b>N</b>. In
<b>C</b>, <b>M</b> he goes abroad, Quentin Durward fashion, not to
gratify his taste for travel, but to serve for meat and fee. <b>F</b>
makes him go to the Holy Land, without specifying his motive, but we
may fairly suppose it religious. <b>C</b> sends him no further than
France, and <b>M</b> to an unnamed foreign land. He becomes the slave
of a Moor or Turk, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>I</b>,
<b>L</b>, <b>N</b>, or a "Prudent," <b>F</b>, who treats him cruelly.
They bore his shoulders and put in a "tree," and make him draw carts,
like horse or ox, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>D</b>, [<b>E</b>], <b>H</b>;
draw plough and harrow, <b>F</b>, plough and cart, <b>N</b>; or tread
the wine-press, <b>I</b>. This is because he is a staunch Christian,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-456" id="Pg_1-456">[Pg 456]</a></span>
and would never bend a knee to Mahound or Termagant, <b>E</b>, or
onie of their stocks, <b>H</b>, or gods, <b>I</b>. They cast him
into a dungeon, where he can neither hear nor see, and he is nigh
perishing with hunger. This, also, is done in <b>H</b> 5, on account
of his perseverance in Christianity; but in <b>C</b>, <b>M</b> he is
imprisoned for falling in love with the king's daughter, or other
lovely may.</p>

<p>From his prison Beichan makes his moan (not to a stock or a stone,
but to the Queen of Heaven, <b>D</b> 4). His hounds go masterless,
his hawks flee from tree to tree, his younger brother will heir his
lands, and he shall never see home again, <b>E</b>, <b>H</b>. If a
lady [earl] would borrow him, he would run at her stirrup; if a widow
[auld wife] would borrow him, he would become her son; and if a maid
would borrow him, he would wed her with a ring, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>,
<b>M</b>, <b>B</b>.<a name="FNanchor_1_407" id="FNanchor_1_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> The only daughter of the Moor, Turk, or
king (of a 'Savoyen,' <b>B</b> 5, perhaps a corruption of Saracen),
already interested in the captive, or immediately becoming so upon
hearing Beichan's song, asks him if he has lands and means at home
to maintain a lady that should set him free, and is told that he has
ample estates, all of which he would bestow on such a lady, <b>A</b>,
<b>B</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>L</b>, <b>N</b>. She steals
the keys and delivers the prisoner, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>,
<b>I</b>, <b>J</b>, <b>L</b>, <b>M</b>, <b>N</b>; refreshes him with
bread and wine [wine], <b>A</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>J</b>
4, <b>K</b> 3, <b>B</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>L</b>; supplies him with money,
<b>C</b> 9, <b>H</b> 15, <b>M</b> 12, <b>N</b> 14, and with a ship,
<b>F</b> 9, <b>H</b> 18, <b>L</b> 9; to which <b>C</b>, <b>M</b> add a
horse and hounds [and hawks, <b>M</b>]. She bids him mind on the lady's
love that freed him out of pine, <b>A</b> 8, <b>D</b> 12, [<b>E</b>
13], <b>M</b> 14, <b>N</b> 15, and in <b>E</b> 16 breaks a ring from
her finger, and gives half of it to Beichan to assist his memory. There
is a solemn vow, or at least a clear understanding, that they are to
marry within seven years, <b>A</b> 9, <b>B</b> 9, <b>E</b> 12 f.,
<b>H</b> 17, 19, <b>L</b> 8, <b>N</b> 11 [three years, <b>C</b> 11].</p>

<p>When seven years are at an end, or even before, Susan Pye feels a
longing, or a misgiving, which impels her to go in search of the object
of her affections, and she sets her foot on good shipboard, and turns
her back on her own country, <b>A</b> 10, <b>B</b> 10, <b>D</b> 15,
<b>L</b> 10, <b>N</b> 23.<a name="FNanchor_1_408" id="FNanchor_1_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> <b>C</b> and <b>M</b> preserve here a
highly important feature which is wanting in the other versions. Isbel,
or Essels, is roused from her sleep by the Billy Blin, <b>C</b> 14, by
a woman in green, a fairy, <b>M</b> 15, who makes known to her that
that very day, or the morn, is Bekie's [Bondwell's] wedding day. She is
directed to attire herself and her maids very splendidly, and go to the
strand; a vessel will come sailing to her, and they are to go on board.
The Billy Blin will row her over the sea, <b>C</b> 19; she will stroke
the ship with a wand, and take God to be her pilot, <b>M</b> 19. Thus,
by miraculous intervention, she arrives at the nick of time.</p>

<p>Beichan's fickleness is not accounted for in most of the versions.
He soon forgot his deliverer and courted another, he was young, and
thought not upon Susan Pye, say <b>H</b>, <b>N</b>. <b>C</b>, on the
contrary, tells us that Beichan had not been a twelvemonth in his own
country, when he was forced to marry a duke's daughter or lose all his
land. <b>E</b> and <b>K</b> intimate that he acts under constraint; the
wedding has lasted three and thirty days, and he will not bed with his
bride for love of one beyond the sea, <b>E</b> 21, <b>K</b> 1.<a name="FNanchor_1_409" id="FNanchor_1_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a></p>

<p>On landing, Susan Pye falls in with a shepherd feeding his flock,
<b>E</b>, <b>K</b> [a boy watering his steeds, <b>M</b>]. She asks,
Whose are these sheep, these kye, these castles? and is told they are
Lord Beichan's, <b>G</b>. She asks the news, and is informed that
there is a wedding in yonder hall that has lasted thirty days and
three, <b>E</b>, <b>K</b>, or that there is to be a wedding on the
morn, <b>M</b>; it seems to be a matter generally known, <b>N</b>.
In other versions she comes directly to Young Beichan's hall, and is
first informed by the porter, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>H</b>,
<b>L</b>, or the fact is confirmed by the porter, <b>E</b>, <b>M</b>,
<b>N</b>; she hears the music within, and divines, <b>C</b>. She bribes
the porter to bid the bridegroom come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-457" id="Pg_1-457">[Pg 457]</a></span> and speak to her, <b>A</b>,
<b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>J</b>, <b>N</b>; send her down bread
and wine, and not forget the lady who brought him out of prison,
<b>B</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>J</b>, <b>K</b>, <b>L</b>. In <b>E</b>
26 she sends up her half ring to the bridegroom [a ring in <b>N</b> 40,
but not till Beichan has declined to come down].</p>

<p>The porter falls on his knee and informs his master that the fairest
and richest lady that eyes ever saw is at the gate [ladies, <b>C</b>,
<b>M</b>]. The bride, or the bride's mother more commonly, reproves
the porter for his graceless speech; he might have excepted the
bride, or her mother, or both: "Gin she be braw without, we's be as
braw within." But the porter is compelled by truth to persist in his
allegation; fair as they may be, they were never to compare with yon
lady, <b>B</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>M</b>. Beichan takes
the table with his foot and makes the cups and cans to flee, <b>B</b>
18, <b>D</b> 23, <b>F</b> 28, <b>G</b> 3, <b>H</b> 47, <b>J</b> 5,
<b>N</b> 42;<a name="FNanchor_1_410" id="FNanchor_1_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> he exclaims that it can be none but Susie Pye,
<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>I</b> [Burd
Isbel, <b>C</b>], and clears the stair, fifteen steps, thirty steps,
in three bounds, <b>A</b> 19, <b>D</b> 24, <b>N</b> 43. His old love
reproaches him for his forgetfulness, <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>,
<b>M</b>, <b>N</b>;<a name="FNanchor_1_411" id="FNanchor_1_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> she asks back her faith and troth, <b>B</b>
21. Beichan bids the forenoon bride's mother take back her daughter: he
will double her dowry, <b>A</b> 22, <b>D</b> 27, <b>E</b> 39; she came
on horseback, she shall go back in chariots, coaches, three, <b>B</b>
22, <b>D</b> 27<a name="FNanchor_1_412" id="FNanchor_1_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> [<b>H</b> 49, in chariot free]. He marries Susie
Pye, having her baptized by the name of Lady Jean, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>,
<b>D</b>, [<b>E</b>], <b>F</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>J</b>.<a name="FNanchor_1_413" id="FNanchor_1_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a></p>

<p>This story of Beichan, or Bekie, agrees in the general outline, and
also in some details, with a well-known legend about Gilbert Beket,
father of St Thomas. The earlier and more authentic biographies lack
this particular bit of romance, but the legend nevertheless goes back
to a date not much later than a century after the death of the saint,
being found in a poetical narrative preserved in a manuscript of about
1300.<a name="FNanchor_1_414" id="FNanchor_1_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a></p>

<p>We learn from this legend that Gilbert Beket, in his youth, assumed
the cross and went to the Holy Land, accompanied only by one Richard,
his servant. They "did their pilgrimage" in holy places, and at last,
with other Christians, were made captive by the Saracens and put in
strong prison. They suffered great hardship and ignominy in the service
of the Saracen prince Admiraud. But Gilbert found more grace than the
rest; he was promoted to serve the prince at meat (in his chains), and
the prince often would ask him about England and the English faith.
Admiraud's only daughter fell in love with Gilbert, and when she saw
her time, in turn asked him the like questions. Gilbert told her that
he was born in London; told her of the belief of Christians, and of the
endless bliss that should be their meed. The maid asked him if he was
ready<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-458" id="Pg_1-458">[Pg 458]</a></span> to die for his Lord's love, and Gilbert declared that he would,
joyfully. When the maid saw that he was so steadfast, she stood long in
thought, and then said, I will quit all for love of thee, and become
Christian, if thou wilt marry me. Gilbert feared that this might be a
wile; he replied that he was at her disposition, but he must bethink
himself. She went on loving him, the longer the more. After this
Gilbert and the rest broke prison and made their way to the Christians.
The prince's daughter, reduced to desperation by love and grief, left
her heritage and her kin, sparing for no sorrow, peril, or contempt
that might come to her, not knowing whither to go or whether he would
marry her when found, and went in quest of Gilbert. She asked the way
to England, and when she had come there had no word but London to
assist her further. She roamed through the streets, followed by a noisy
and jeering crowd of wild boys and what not, until one day by chance
she stopped by the house in which Gilbert lived. The man Richard,
hearing a tumult, came out to see what was the matter, recognized the
princess, and ran to tell his master.<a name="FNanchor_1_415" id="FNanchor_1_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> Gilbert bade Richard take
the lady to the house of a respectable woman near by, and presently
went to see her. She swooned when she saw him. Gilbert was nothing
if not discreet: he "held him still," as if he had nothing in mind.
But there was a conference of six bishops just then at St. Paul's,
and he went and told them his story and asked advice. One of the six
prophetically saw a divine indication that the two were meant to be
married, and all finally recommended this if the lady would become
Christian. Brought before the bishops, she said, Most gladly, if he
will espouse me; else I had not left my kin. She was baptized<a name="FNanchor_1_416" id="FNanchor_1_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> with
great ceremony, and the marriage followed.</p>

<p>The very day after the wedding Gilbert was seized with such an
overmastering desire to go back to the Holy Land that he wist not what
to do. But his wife was thoroughly converted, and after a struggle with
herself she consented, on condition that Beket should leave with her
the man Richard, who knew her language. Gilbert was gone three years
and a half, and when he came back Thomas was a fine boy.</p>

<p>That our ballad has been <i>affected</i> by the legend of Gilbert Beket is
altogether likely. The name Bekie is very close to Beket, and several
versions, <b>A</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>N</b>, set out
rather formally with the announcement that Bekie was London born, like
the Latin biographies and the versified one of Garnier de Pont Sainte
Maxence. Our ballad, also, in some versions, has the Moor's daughter
baptized, a point which of course could not fail in the legend. More
important still is it that the hero of the English ballad goes home and
forgets the woman he has left in a foreign land, instead of going away
from home and forgetting the love he has left there. But the ballad,
for all that, is not derived from the legend. Stories and ballads of
the general cast of 'Young Beichan' are extremely frequent.<a name="FNanchor_1_417" id="FNanchor_1_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> The
leg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-459" id="Pg_1-459">[Pg 459]</a></span>end lacks some of the main points of these stories, and the ballad,
in one version or another, has them, as will be seen by referring to
what has been said under 'Hind Horn,' pp 194 ff. Bekie and Beket go to
the East, like Henry and Reinfrit of Brunswick, the Noble Moringer, the
good Gerhard, Messer Torello, the Sire de Créqui, Alexander of Metz,
and others. Like the larger part of these, they are made prisoners by
the Saracens. He will not bow the knee to Mahound; neither will the
Sire de Créqui, though he die for it.<a name="FNanchor_1_418" id="FNanchor_1_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> Beichan is made to draw
cart, plough, harrow, like a beast. So Henry of Brunswick in a Swedish
and a Danish ballad,<a name="FNanchor_1_419" id="FNanchor_1_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> and Alexander von Metz, or the Graf von Rom,
in his most beautiful and touching story.<a name="FNanchor_1_420" id="FNanchor_1_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> Henry of Brunswick is
set free by a "heathen" lady in the Danish ballad. In one version of
Beichan, <b>E</b>, the lady on parting with her love breaks her ring
and gives him one half, as Henry, or his wife, Reinfrit, Gerhard,
Créqui, and others do. At this point in the story the woman pursues the
man, and parts are inverted. Susan Pye is warned that Beichan is to be
married the next day, in <b>C</b> by a Billy-Blin, in <b>M</b> by a
woman in green, or fairy, and is conveyed to Beichan's castle or hall
with miraculous despatch, just as Henry and others are warned, and are
transported to their homes by devil, angel, or necromancer. In <b>E</b>
and <b>N</b> the old love is identified by a half ring or ring, as in
so many of the stories of the class of Henry the Lion.</p>

<p>Norse, Spanish, and Italian ballads preserve a story essentially the
same as that of 'Young Beichan.'</p>

<p>The variations of these twelve versions are insignificant. The names
Herr Peder den Rige and Ellensborg [Ellen] are found in nearly all.
It comes into Sir Peter's mind that he ought to go to Jerusalem to
expiate his sins, and he asks his betrothed, Ellensborg, how long she
will wait for him. She will wait eight years, and marry no other,
though the king should woo her [seven, <b>L</b>; nine, <b>M</b>,
"If I do not come then, break the engagement;" eight, and not more,
<b>N</b>]. The time passes and Peter does not come back. Ellensborg
goes to the strand. Traders come steering in, and she is asked to buy
of their ware,&mdash;sendal, linen, and silk green as leek. She cares not
for these things; have they not seen her sister's son [brother], for
whom she is grieving to death? They know nothing of her sister's son,
but well they know Sir Peter the rich: he has betrothed a lady in the
Øs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-460" id="Pg_1-460">[Pg 460]</a></span>ter-king's realm;<a name="FNanchor_1_421" id="FNanchor_1_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> a heathen woman, "and you never came into
his mind," <b>E</b> 13; he is to be married to-morrow, <b>K</b> 6.
A wee swain tells her, <b>M</b> 14, 16, that he sits in Austurríki
drinking the ale of forgetfulness, and will never come home; he shall
not drink long, says she. Ellensborg asks her brother to undertake
a voyage for her; he will go with her if she will wait till summer;
rather than wait till summer she will go alone, <b>A</b>, <b>D</b>,
<b>G</b>. She asks fraternal advice about going in search of her lover,
<b>A</b>, <b>E</b>, the advice of her uncles, <b>I</b>; asks the loan
of a ship, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>N</b>. She is
told that such a thing would be a shame; she had better take another
lover; the object is not worth the trouble; the voyage is bad for a man
and worse for a woman. Her maids give her advice that is more to her
mind, <b>E</b>, but are as prudent as the rest in the later <b>I</b>.
She attires herself like a knight, clips her maids' hair, <b>B</b>,
<b>H</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>L</b>, <b>M</b>, and puts them into men's
clothes, <b>D</b>, <b>L</b>; sets herself to steer and the maids to
row, <b>A-G</b>, <b>L</b>.<a name="FNanchor_1_422" id="FNanchor_1_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a></p>

<p>The voyage is less than two months, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>E</b>;
less than three months, <b>I</b>; quite three months, <b>L</b>. It
is the first day of the bridal when she lands, <b>B</b> 22, <b>E</b>
24, <b>N</b> 14; in <b>B</b> Ellensborg learns this from a boy who is
walking on the sand. Sword at side, she enters the hall where Peter is
drinking his bridal. Peter, can in hand, rises and says, Bless your
eyes, my sister's son; welcome to this strange land. In <b>B</b> he
asks, How are my father and mother? and she tells him that his father
lies dead on his bier, his mother in sick-bed. In <b>L</b>, waiting for
no greeting, she says, Well you sit at the board with your wife! Are
all lords wont thus to keep their faith? The bride's mother, <b>D</b>,
<b>G</b>, the heathen bride, <b>E</b>, an unnamed person, probably the
bride, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>N</b>, says, That is not your
sister's son, but much more like a woman; her hair is like spun gold,
and braided up under a silk cap.</p>

<p><b>A</b> tells us, and so <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>, that it was two months
before Ellensborg could speak to Peter privately. Then, on a Yule day,
when he was going to church, she said, It does not occur to you that
you gave me your troth. Sir Peter stood as if women had shorn his
hair, and recollected all as if it had been yesterday. In <b>B-E</b>,
<b>H</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>L</b>, <b>M</b>, <b>N</b>, this incident has,
perhaps, dropped out. In these immediately, as in <b>A</b>, <b>F</b>,
<b>G</b>, after this interview, Sir Peter, recalled to his senses or
to his fidelity, conceives the purpose of flying with Ellensborg. Good
people, he says, knights and swains, ladies and maids, follow my bride
to bed, while I take my sister's son over the meads, through the wood,
<b>B-E</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>N</b>. In <b>A</b>, <b>F</b>, Sir
Peter asks the bride how long she will bide while he takes his nephew
across the kingdom; in <b>G</b> begs the boon that, since his sister's
son is going, he may ride with him, just accompany him to the strand
and take leave of him; in <b>L</b>, <b>M</b>, hopes she will not be
angry if he convoys his nephew three days on his way. (It is at this
point in <b>C</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>L</b>, that the bride says
it is no sister's son, but a woman.) The bride remarks that there are
knights and swains enow to escort his sister's son, and that he might
more fitly stay where he is, but Sir Peter persists that he will see
his nephew off in person.</p>

<p>Sir Peter and Ellensborg go aboard the ship, he crying, You will see me
no more! When they are at sea Ellensborg lets out her hair, <b>A</b>,
<b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>H</b>; she wishes that the abandoned bride
may now feel the grief which she herself had borne for years. The
proceeding is less covert in <b>I</b>, <b>L</b>, <b>M</b> than in the
other versions.</p>

<p>As Ellensborg and Peter are making for the ship in <b>D</b> 30, 31
(and <b>G</b> 36, 37, borrowed from <b>D</b>), she says, Tell me, Sir
Peter, why would you deceive me so? Sir Peter answers that he never
meant to deceive her; it was the lady of Østerland that did it; she
had changed his mind. A magical change is meant. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-461" id="Pg_1-461">[Pg 461]</a></span> agrees with
what is said in <b>A</b> 24, 25 (also <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>), that when
Ellensborg got Peter alone to herself, and said, You do not remember
that you plighted your troth to me, everything came back to him as if
it had happened yesterday. And again in the Färöe copy, <b>L</b> 49,
Ellensborg, from the prow, cries to Ingibjörg on the strand, Farewell
to thee with thy <i>elf-ways</i>, við títt elvargangi! I have taken to
myself my true love that I lent thee so long; implying that Sir Peter
had been detained by Circean arts, by a sleepy drench of óminnis öl,
or ale of forgetfulness, Icelandic <b>M</b> 14, which, in the light of
the other ballads, is to be understood literally, and not figuratively.
The feature of a man being made, by magical or other means, to forget a
first love who had done and suffered much for him, and being suddenly
restored to consciousness and his original predilection, is of the
commonest occurrence in traditional tales.<a name="FNanchor_1_423" id="FNanchor_1_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a></p>

<p>Our English ballad affords no other positive trace of external
interference with the hero's will than the far-fetched allegation in
<b>C</b> that the choice before him was to accept a duke's daughter
or forfeit his lands. The explanation of his inconstancy in <b>H</b>,
<b>N</b>, that young men ever were fickle found, is vulgar, and also
insufficient, for Beichan returns to his old love <i>per saltum</i>, like
one from whose eyes scales have fallen and from whose back a weight has
been taken, not tamely, like a facile youth that has swerved. <b>E</b>
and <b>K</b>, as already said, distinctly recognize that Beichan was
not acting with free mind, and, for myself, I have little doubt that,
if we could go back far enough, we should find that he had all along
been faithful at heart.</p>

<p><b>Spanish.</b> <b>A.</b> 'El Conde Sol,' Duran, Romancero, I, 180,
No 327, from tradition in Andalusia, by the editor; Wolf and Hofmann,
Primavera, II, 48, No 135. In this most beautiful romance the County
Sol, named general in great wars between Spain and Portugal, and
leaving a young wife dissolved in tears, tells her that she is free
to marry if he does not come back in six years. Six pass, and eight,
and more than ten, yet the county does not return, nor does there come
news of him. His wife implores and obtains leave of her father to go in
search of her husband. She traverses France and Italy, land and sea,
and is on the point of giving up hope, when one day she sees a herdsman
pasturing cows. Whose are these cows? she asks. The County Sol's, is
the answer. And whose these wheat-fields, these ewes, these gardens,
and that palace? whose the horses I hear neigh? The County Sol's, is
the answer in each case.<a name="FNanchor_1_424" id="FNanchor_1_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> And who that lady that a man folds in his
arms? The lady is betrothed to him and the county is to marry her. The
countess changes her silken robe for the herdsman's sackcloth, and goes
to ask an alms at the county's gate. Beyond all hope, the county comes
out himself to bring it. "Whence comest thou, pilgrim?" he asks. She
was born in Spain. "How didst thou make thy way hither?" She came to
seek her husband, footing the thorns by land, risking the perils of the
sea; and when she found him he was about to marry, he had forgotten his
faithful wife. "Pilgrim, thou art surely the devil, come to try me."
"No devil," she said, "but thy wife indeed, and therefore come to seek
thee." Upon this, without a moment's tarrying, the county ordered his
horse, took up his wife, and made his best speed to his native castle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-462" id="Pg_1-462">[Pg 462]</a></span>
The bride he would have taken remained unmarried, for those that put on
others' robes are sure to be stripped naked.</p>

<p><b>B.</b> 'Gerineldo,' taken down in Asturias by Amador de los Rios,
Jahrbuch für romanische u. englische Literatur, III, 290, 1861, and the
same year (Nigra) in Revista Iberica, I, 51; a version far inferior to
<b>A</b>, and differing in no important respect as to the story.</p>

<p><b>C.</b> 'La boda interrumpida,' Milá, Romancerillo Catalan, p. 221,
No 244, seven copies, A-G, none good. A, which is about one third
Castilian, relates that war is declared between France and Portugal,
and the son of Conde Burgos made general. The countess his wife does
nothing but weep. The husband tells her to marry again if he does not
come back in seven years. More than seven years are gone, and the
lady's father asks why she does not marry. "How can I," she replies,
"if the count is living? Give me your blessing, and let me go in search
of him." She goes a hundred leagues on foot, in the disguise of a
pilgrim. Arrived at a palace she sees pages pass, and asks them for
whom a horse is intended. It is for Count Burgos's son, who marries
that night. She asks to be directed to the young count, is told that
she will find him in the hall, enters, and begs an alms, as coming from
Italy and without a penny. The young man says, If you come from Italy,
what is the news? Is Conde Bueso's wife living? The pilgrim desires
some description of the lady. It seems that she wore a very costly
petticoat on her wedding-day. The pilgrim takes off <i>her glove</i> and
shows her ring; she also takes off and shows the expensive petticoat.
There is great weeping in that palace, for first wives never can be
forgotten. Don Bueso and the pilgrim clap hands and go home.</p>

<p><b>Italian: Piedmontese.</b> <b>A.</b> 'Moran d'Inghilterra,'
communicated to Rivista Contemporanea, XXXI, 3, 1862, by Nigra, who
gives the variations of four other versions. The daughter of the sultan
is so handsome that they know not whom to give her to, but decide upon
Moran of England. The first day of his marriage he did nothing but
kiss her, the second he wished to leave her, and the third he went off
to the war. "When shall you return?" asked his wife. "If not in seven
years, marry." She waited seven years, but Moran did not come. His wife
went all over England on horseback, and came upon a cowherd. "Whose
cows are these?" she asked. They were Moran's. "Has Moran a wife?" This
is the day when he is to marry, and if she makes haste she will be in
time for the wedding. She spurs her horse, and arrives in season. They
offer her to drink in a gold cup. She will drink from no cup that is
not her own; she will not drink while another woman is there; she will
not drink till she is mistress. Moran throws his arms round her neck,
saying, Mistress you ever have been and still shall be.</p>

<p><b>B.</b> 'Morando,' Ferraro, Canti popolari monferrini, p. 42, No 32,
from Alessandria. Murando d'Inghilterra, of the king's household, fell
in love with the princess, for which the king sent him off. The lady
knocked at his door, and asked when he would come back. In seven years,
was the answer, and if not she was to marry. The princess stole a
hundred scudi from her father, frizzled her hair French fashion, bought
a fashionable suit, and rode three days and nights without touching
ground, eating, or drinking. She came upon a laundryman, and asked who
was in command there. Murando. She knocked at the door, and Murando
asked, Have you come to our wedding? She would come to the dance. At
the dance she was recognized by the servants. Murando asked, How came
you here? "I rode three days and three nights without touching ground,
eating, or drinking." This is my wife, said Murando; and the other lady
he bade return to her father.</p>

<p>It is possible that this ballad may formerly have been known in France.
Nothing is left and known that shows this conclusively, but there is
an approach to the Norse form in a fragment which occurs in several
widely separated localities. A lover goes off in November, promising
his love to return in December, but does not. A messenger comes to bid
the lady, in his name, seek another lover, for he has another love.
"Is she fairer than I, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-463" id="Pg_1-463">[Pg 463]</a></span> more powerful?" She is not fairer, but more
powerful: she makes rosemary flower on the edge of her sleeve, changes
the sea into wine and fish into flesh. Bujeaud, I, 203. In 'La Femme
Abandonnée,' Puymaigre, I, 72, the lover is married to a Fleming:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Elle fait venir le soleil<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A minuit dans sa chambre,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Elle fait bouiller la marmite<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sans feu et sans rente.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In a Canadian version, 'Entre Paris et Saint-Denis,' Gagnon, p. 303,
the deserted woman is a king's daughter, and the new love,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ell' fait neiger, ell' fait grêler,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ell' fait le vent qui vente.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ell' fait reluire le soleil<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A minuit dans sa chambre.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ell' fait pousser le romarin<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sur le bord de la manche.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Puymaigre notes that there is a version very near to the Canadian in
the sixth volume of Poésies populaires de la France, cinquième recueil,
Ardennes, No 2.<a name="FNanchor_1_425" id="FNanchor_1_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a></p>

<p>A broadside ballad, 'The Turkish Lady,' 'The Turkish Lady and the
English Slave,' printed in Logan's Pedlar's Pack, p. 16, Christie, I,
247, from singing, and preserved also in the Kinloch MSS, V, 53, I,
263, from Elizabeth Beattie's recitation, simply relates how a Turkish
pirate's daughter fell in love with an Englishman, her slave, offered
to release him if he would turn Turk, but chose the better part of
flying with him to Bristol, and becoming herself a Christian brave.</p>

<p>Sir William Stanley, passing through Constantinople, is condemned to
die for his religion. A lady, walking under the prison walls, hears
his lament, and begs his life of the Turk. She would make him her
husband, and bring him to adore Mahomet. She offers to set the prisoner
free if he will marry her, but he has a wife and children on English
ground. The lady is sorry, but generously gives Stanley five hundred
pounds to carry him to his own country. Sir William Stanley's Garland,
Halliwell's Palatine Anthology, pp 277 f.</p>

<p>Two Magyars have been shut up in a dungeon by the sultan, and have not
seen sun, moon, or stars for seven years. The sultan's daughter hears
their moan, and offers to free them if they will take her to Hungary.
This they promise to do. She gets the keys, takes money, opens the
doors, and the three make off. They are followed; one of the Magyars
kills all the pursuers but one, who is left to carry back the news.
It is now proposed that there shall be a duel to determine who shall
have the lady. She begs them rather to cut off her head than to fight
about her. Szilágyi Niklas says he has a love at home, and leaves the
sultan's daughter to his comrade, Hagymási László. Aigner, Ungarische
Volksdichtungen, p. 93: see p. 107 of this volume.</p>

Moor's castle there was a massymore, which is a dark dungeon
for keeping prisoners. It was twenty feet below the ground, and
into this hole they closed poor Beichan. There he stood, night
and day, up to his waist in puddle water; but night or day it
was all one to him, for no ae styme of light ever got in. So
he lay there a lang and weary while, and thinking on his heavy
weird, he made a murnfu sang to pass the time, and this was
the sang that he made, and grat when he sang it, for he never
thought of ever escaping from the massymore, or of seeing his
ain country again:</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_414" id="Footnote_1_414"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_414"><span class="label">[414]</span></a> Harleian MS. 2277, from which the life of Beket, in long
couplets, was printed by Mr W. H. Black for the Percy Society, in 1845.
The story of Gilbert Beket is contained in the first 150 vv. The style
of this composition entirely resembles that of Robert of Gloucester,
and portions of the life of Beket are identical with the Chronicle;
whence Mr Black plausibly argues that both are by the same hand. The
account of Beket's parentage is interpolated into Edward Grim's Life,
in Cotton MS. Vitellius, C, <span class="smcap">XII</span>, from which it is printed by
Robertson, Materials for the History of Thomas Becket, II, 453 ff.
It is found in Bromton's Chronicle, Twysden, Scriptores X, columns
1052-55, and in the First Quadrilogus, Paris, 1495, from which it is
reprinted by Migne, Patrologiæ Cursus Completus, CXC, cols 346 ff.
The tale has been accepted by many writers who would have been better
historians for a little reading of romances. Angustin Thierry sees
in Thomas Beket a Saxon contending in high place, for the interests
and with the natural hatred of his race, against Norman Henry, just
as he finds in the yeoman Robin Hood a leader of Saxon serfs engaged
in irregular war with Norman Richard. But both of St Thomas's parents
were Norman; the father of Rouen, the mother of Caen. The legend was
introduced by Lawrence Wade, following John of Exeter, into a metrical
life of Beket of about the year 1500: see the poem in Englische
Studien, III, 417, edited by Horstmann.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_415" id="Footnote_1_415"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_415"><span class="label">[415]</span></a> Richard, the proud porter of the ballads, is perhaps
most like himself in <b>M</b> 32 ff.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_416" id="Footnote_1_416"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_416"><span class="label">[416]</span></a> Neither her old name nor her Christian name is told us
in this legend. Gilbert Beket's wife was Matilda, according to most
authorities, but Roësa according to one: see Robertson, as above,
IV, 81; Migne, cols 278 f. Fox has made Roësa into Rose, Acts and
Monuments, I, 267, ed. 1641.
</p>
<p>
Gilbert and Rose (but Roësa is not Rose) recall to Hippeau, Vie de St
Thomas par Garnier de Pont Sainte Maxence, p. xxiii, Elie de Saint
Gille and Rosamonde, whose adventures have thus much resemblance with
those of Beket and of Bekie. Elie de Saint Gille, after performing
astounding feats of valor in fight with a horde of Saracens who have
made a descent on Brittany, is carried off to their land. The amiral
Macabré requires Elie to adore Mahomet; Elie refuses in the most
insolent terms, and is condemned to the gallows. He effects his escape,
and finds himself before Macabré's castle. Here, in another fight, he
is desperately wounded, but is restored by the skill of Rosamonde, the
amiral's daughter, who is Christian at heart, and loves the Frank. To
save her from being forced to marry the king of Bagdad, Elie fights
as her champion. In the end she is baptized, as a preparation for
her union with Elie, but he, having been present at the ceremony, is
adjudged by the archbishop to be gossip to her, and Elie and Rosamonde
are otherwise disposed of. So the French romance, but in the Norse,
which, as Kölbing maintains, is likely to preserve the original story
here, there is no such splitting of cumin, and hero and heroine are
united.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_417" id="Footnote_1_417"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_417"><span class="label">[417]</span></a> There is one in the Gesta Romanorum, cap. 5, Österley,
p. 278, of about the same age as the Beket legend. It is not
particularly important. A young man is captured by a pirate, and his
father will not send his ransom. The pirate's daughter often visits the
captive, who appeals to her to exert herself for his liberation. She
promises to effect his freedom if he will marry her. This he agrees to.
She releases him from his chains without her father's knowledge, and
flies with him to his native land.</p></div>

Tyana's encounter with an <i>empusa</i> between the Caucasus and the
Indus. Knowing what the spectre was, Apollonius began to revile it,
and told his attendants to do the same, for that was the resource,
in such cases, against an attack. The empusa went off with a shriek.
Philostratus's Life of Apollonius, II, 4. Mr Kittredge referred me
later to what is said by Col. Yule (who also cites Philostratus),
Marco Polo, I, 183, that the wise, according to Mas'udi, revile ghúls,
and the ghúls vanish. Mr Kittredge also cites Luther's experience:
how, when he could not be rid of the Devil by the use of holy writ
and serious words, "so hätte er ihn oft mit spitzigen Worten und
lächerlichen Possen vertrieben; ... quia est superbus spiritus, et non
potest ferre contemptum sui." Tischreden, in Auswahl, Berlin, 1877, pp
152-154.</p>

<h4>4. Lady Isabel and the Elf-Knight.</h4>

<p><b>P.</b> <a href="#Pg_1-22">22</a> b. <b>D.</b> Add: <b>d.</b> 'The historical ballad of May
Culzean,' an undated stall-copy.</p>

<p><a href="#Pg_1-26">26</a> b. Another Dutch version (Frisian), spirited, but with gaps, is
given by Dykstra and van der Meulen, In Doaze fol alde Snypsnaren,
Frjentsjer, 1882, p. 118, 'Jan Alberts,' 66 vv. (Köhler.)</p>

<p><b>D.</b> Jan Alberts sings a song, and those that hear it know it not.
It is heard by a king's daughter, who asks her mother's leave to go out
for a walk, and is told that it is all one where she goes or stays, if
she keeps her honor. Her father says the same, when she applies for
his leave. She goes to her bedroom and dresses herself finely, dons a
gold crown, puts her head out of the window, and cries, Now am I Jan
Alberts' bride. Jan Alberts takes her on his horse; they ride fast and
long, with nothing to eat or drink for three days. She then asks Jan
why he gives her nothing, and he answers that he shall ride to the high
tree where hang fourteen fair maids. Arrived there, he gives her the
choice of tree, sword, or water. She chooses the sword, bids him spare
his coat, for a pure maid's blood goes far, and before his coat is half
off his head lies behind him. The head cries, Behind the bush is a pot
of grease; smear my neck with it. She will not smear from a murderer's
pot, nor blow in a murderer's horn. She mounts his horse, and rides far
and long. Jan Alberts' mother comes to meet her, and asks after him.
She says he is not far off, and is sporting with fourteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-486" id="Pg_1-486">[Pg 486]</a></span> maids. Had
you told me this before, I would have laid you in the water, says the
mother. The maid rides on till she comes to her father's gate. Then she
cries to her father to open, for his youngest daughter is without. The
father not bestirring himself, she swims the moat, and, the door not
being open, goes through the glass. The next day she dries her clothes.</p>

<p><a href="#Pg_1-30">30</a> a, <a href="#Pg_1-37">37</a> a. There is a Low German version of the first class,
<b>A-F</b>, in Spee, Volksthümliches vom Niederrhein, Köln, 1875,
Zweites Heft, p. 3, 'Schöndili,' 50 vv. (Köhler.)</p>

<p><b>AA.</b> Schöndili's parents died when she was a child. Schön-Albert,
knowing this, rides to her. She attires herself in silk, with a gold
crown on her hair, and he swings her on to his horse. They ride three
days and nights, with nothing to eat or drink. She asks whether it is
not meal-time; he replies that they are coming to a linden, where they
will eat and drink. Seven women are hanging on the tree. He gives her
the wale of tree, river, and sword. She chooses the sword; would be
loath to spot his coat; whips off his head before the coat is half off.
The head says there is a pipe in the saddle; she thinks no good can
come of playing a murderer's pipe. She meets first the father, then the
mother; they think that must be Schön-Albert's horse. That may be, she
says; I have not seen him since yesterday. She sets the pipe to her
mouth, when she reaches her father's gate, and the murderers come like
hares on the wind.</p>

fragment of fifteen verses. As Anna sits by the Rhine combing her hair,
Heinrich comes along on his horse, sees her weep, and asks why. It is
not for gold and not for goods, but because she is to die that day.
Heinrich draws his sword, runs her through, and rides home. He is asked
why his sword is red, and says he has killed two doves. They say the
dove must be Anna.</p>

and inferior but still important form of <b>A</b> (Masovian).</p>

<p><b>A b.</b> Ligar (afterwards Jasia, Golo) bids Kasia take all she
has. She has already done this, and is ready to range the world with
him. Suddenly she asks, after they have been some time on their way,
What is that yonder so green? Jasia replies, Our house, to which we
are going. They go on further, and Kasia again inquires abruptly, What
is that yonder so white? "That is my eight wives, and you shall be the
ninth: you are to die, and will be the tenth." "Where is the gold, the
maidens' gold?" "In the linden, Kasia, in the linden; plenty of it."
"Let me not die so wretchedly; let me draw your sword for once." She
drew the sword, and with one stroke Jasia's head was off.</p>

<p><a href="#Pg_1-39">39</a> b. To the Polish versions are further to be added: <b>NN</b>,
Piosnki wie&#347;niacze znad Dzwiny, p. 41, No 51; <b>OO</b>, Roger, p.

No 140; <b>RR</b>, p. 81, No 142; <b>SS</b>, p. 79, No 139. The last
three are imperfect, and <b>QQ</b>, <b>RR</b>, have a beginning which
belongs elsewhere. Jasia suggests to Kasia to get the key of the new
room from her mother by pretending headache, and bids her take gold
enough, <b>NN</b>, <b>OO</b>. They go off while her mother thinks that
Kasia is sleeping, <b>NN</b>, <b>OO</b>, <b>QQ</b>. They come to a
wood, <b>NN</b>, <b>PP</b> (which is corrupt here), <b>SS</b>; first
or last, to a deep stream, <b>NN</b>, <b>OO</b>, <b>QQ</b>, <b>SS</b>;
it is red sea in <b>RR</b>, as in <b>J</b>. Jasia bids Kasia return
to her mother, <b>NN</b> (twice), <b>RR</b>; bids her take off her
rich clothes, <b>OO</b>, to which she answers that she has not come
here for that. John throws her into the water, <b>NN</b>, <b>OO</b>,
<b>QQ</b>, <b>SS</b>, from a bridge in the second and third. Her apron
catches on a stake or post; she begs John for help, and gets for
answer, "I did not throw you in to help you: you may go to the bottom,"
<b>OO</b>. She swims to a stake, to which she clings, and John hews her
in three, <b>QQ</b>. Fishermen draw out the body, and carry it to the
church, <b>NN</b>, <b>OO</b>. She apostrophizes her hair in <b>QQ</b>,
<b>SS</b>, as in <b>G</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>J</b>, and in the same absurd
terms in <b>QQ</b> as in <b>J</b>. John is pursued and cut to pieces
in <b>OO</b>, <i>also</i> broken on the wheel. <b>PP</b> closely resembles
German ballads of the third class. Katie shouts three times: at her
first cry the grass curls up; at the second the river overflows; the
third wakes her mother, who rouses her sons, saying, Katie is calling
in the wood. They find John with a bloody sword; he says he has killed
a dove. They answer, No dove, but our sister, and maltreat him till he
tells what he has done with his victim: "I have hidden her under the
yew-bush; now put me on the wheel."</p>

omit the quotation marks in this and the line before.</p>

<p><a href="#Pg_1-40">40</a> b, line 2 (the girl's adding her hair to lengthen the cord). In the
tale of the Sea-horse, Schiefner, Awarische Texte, Memoirs of the St
Petersburg Academy, vol. <span class="smcap">XIX</span>, No 6, p. 11 f, a sixty-ell rope
being required to rescue a prince from a well into which he had been
thrown, and no rope forthcoming, the daughter of a sea-king makes a
rope of the required length with her hair, and with this the prince
is drawn out. Dr Reinhold Köhler, who pointed out this incident to
me, refers in his notes to the texts, at p. vii f, to the song of
Südäi Märgän, Radloff, II, 627-31, where Südäi Märgän's wife, having
to rescue her husband from a pit, tries first his horse's tail, and
finds it too short, then her hair, which proves also a little short. A
maid is then found whose hair is a hundred fathoms long, and her hair
being tied on to the horse's tail, and horse, wife, and maid pulling
together, the hero is drawn out. For climbing up by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-487" id="Pg_1-487">[Pg 487]</a></span> maid's hair,

<p><a href="#Pg_1-40">40</a> b, line 7. A message is sent to a father by a daughter in the same
way, in Chodzko, Les Chants historiques de l'Ukraine, p. 75; cf. p.
92, of the same. Tristram sends messages to Isonde by linden shavings
inscribed with runes: Sir Tristrem, ed. Kölbing, p. 56, st. 187;

<p><a href="#Pg_1-40">40</a>, note <a href="#Footnote_1_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>. In a Ruthenian ballad a girl who runs away from her
mother with a lover tells her brothers, who have come in search of her,
I did not leave home to go back again with you: Golovatsky, Part I, p.
77, No 32; Part III, <span class="smcap">I</span>, p. 17, No 4, p. 18, No 5. So, "I have
not poisoned you to help you," Part I, p. 206, No 32, p. 207, No 33.</p>

<p><a href="#Pg_1-41">41</a> a, second paragraph. Golovatsky, at I, 116, No 29, has a ballad,
found elsewhere without the feature here to be noticed, in which a
Cossack, who is watering his horse while a maid is drawing water,
describes his home as a Wonderland, like John in Polish <b>Q</b>. "Come
to the Ukraine with the Cossacks," he says. "Our land is not like
this: with us the mountains are golden, the water is mead, the grass
is silk; with us the willows bear pears and the girls go in gold."
She yields; they go over one mountain and another, and when they have
crossed the third the Cossack lets his horse graze. The maid falls to
weeping, and asks the Cossack, Where are your golden mountains, where
the water that is mead, the grass that is silk? He answers, No girl
of sense and reason engages herself to a young Cossack. So in Zegota
Pauli, P. l. ruskiego, p. 29, No 26 == Golovatsky, I, 117, No 30, where
the maid rejoins to the glowing description, I have ranged the world:
golden mountains I never saw; everywhere mountains are of stone, and
everywhere rivers are of water; very like the girl in Grundtvig, 82
<b>B</b>, st. 7; 183 <b>A</b> 6, <b>E</b> 5, 6.</p>

<p><a href="#Pg_1-41">41</a> b, last paragraph. Several Bohemian versions are to be added to the
single example cited from Waldau's Böhmische Granaten. This version,
which is presumed to have been taken down by Waldau himself, may
be distinguished as <b>A</b>. <b>B</b>, Su&#353;il, Moravské Národní
Písn&#277;, No 189, p. 191, 'Vrah,' 'The Murderer,' is very like
<b>A</b>. <b>C</b>, Su&#353;il, p. 193. <b>D</b>, Erben, Prostonárodni
&#269;eské Písn&#277; a &#344;íkadla, p. 480, No 16, 'Zabité d&#277;v&#269;e,'
'The Murdered Maid.' <b>E</b>, p. 479, No 15, 'Zabitá sestra,' 'The
Murdered Sister.' <b>B</b> has a double set of names, beginning with
Black George,&mdash;not the Servian, but "king of Hungary,"&mdash;and ending with
Indriasch. The maid is once called Annie, otherwise Katie. At her first
call the grass becomes green; at the second the mountain bows; the
third the mother hears. <b>C</b> has marvels of its own. Anna entreats
John to allow her to call to her mother. "Call, call," he says, "you
will not reach her with your call; in this dark wood, even the birds
will not hear you." At her first call a pine-tree in the forest breaks;
at the second the river overflows; at the third her mother rises from
the grave. She calls to her sons to go to Anna's rescue, and <i>they</i>
rise from their graves. The miscreant John confesses that he has
buried their sister in the wood. They strike off his head, and put a
bat on the head, with an inscription in gold letters, to inform people
what his offence has been. There is a gap after the seventh stanza of
<b>D</b>, which leaves the two following stanzas unintelligible by
themselves: 8, Choose one of the two, and trust nobody; 9, She made her
choice, and shouted three times towards the mountains. At the first cry
the mountain became green; at the second the mountain bowed backwards;
the third the mother heard. She sent her sons off; they found their
neighbor John, who had cut off their sister's head. The law-abiding,
and therefore modern, young men say that John shall go to prison and
never come out alive. In <b>E</b> the man, a young hunter, says, Call
<i>five</i> times; not even a wood-bird will hear you. Nothing is said of
the first call; the second is heard by the younger brother, who tells
the elder that their sister must be in trouble. The hunter has a bloody
rifle in his hand: how he is disposed of we are not told. All these
ballads but <b>C</b> begin with the maid cutting grass, and all of them
have the dove that is "no dove, but our sister."</p>

<p>Fragments of this ballad are found, <b>F</b>, in Su&#353;il, p. 112, No
113, 'Nev&#277;sta ne&#353;t' astnice,' 'The Unhappy Bride;' <b>G</b>,
p. 171, No 171, 'Zbojce,' 'The Murderer;' and there is a variation
from <b>B</b> at p. 192, note 3, which is worth remarking, <b>H</b>.
<b>F</b>, sts 11-14: "Get together what belongs to you; we will go
to a foreign land;" and when they came to the turf, "Look my head
through."<a name="FNanchor_1_426" id="FNanchor_1_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> Every hair she laid aside she wet with a tear. And
when they came into the dark of the wood he cut her into nine [three]
pieces. <b>G.</b> Katie meets John in a meadow; they sit down on the
grass. "Look my head through." She weeps, for she says there is a black
fate impending over her; "a black one for me, a red one for thee." He
gets angry, cuts off her head, and throws her into the river, for which
he is hanged. <b>H.</b> He sprang from his horse, robbed the maid, and
laughed. He set her on the grass, and bade her look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-488" id="Pg_1-488">[Pg 488]</a></span> his head through.
Every hair she examined she dropped a tear for. "Why do you weep,
Katie? Is it for your crants?" "I am <i>not</i> weeping for my crants, nor
am I afraid of your sword. Let me call three times, that my father and
mother may hear." Compare German <b>H</b> 10, 11; <b>Q</b> 8-10, etc.,
etc.</p>

<p><a href="#Pg_1-42">42</a> a. These Ruthenian ballads belong with the other Slavic parallels
to No 4: <b>A</b>, Zegota Pauli, P. l. ruskiego, p. 21 == Golovatsky,
III, <span class="smcap">I</span>, 149, No 21; <b>B</b>, Golovatsky, III, <span class="smcap">I</span>,
172, No 46. <b>A.</b> A man induces a girl to go off with him in the
night. They wander over one land and another, and then feel need of
rest. Why does your head ache? he asks of her. Are you homesick? "My
head does not ache; I am not homesick." He takes her by the white sides
and throws her into the deep Donau, saying, Swim with the stream; we
shall not live together. She swims over the yellow sand, crying, Was
I not fair, or was it my fate? and he dryly answers, Fair; it was thy
fate. In <b>B</b> it is a Jew's daughter that is wiled away. They go
in one wagon; another is laden with boxes [of valuables?] and pillows,
a third with gold pennies. She asks, Where is your house? Over those
hills, he answers. He takes her over a high bridge, and throws her into
the Donau, with, Swim, since you were not acquainted with our way, our
faith!</p>

p. 45 f. A handsome wench, who had been lost seven years, suddenly
reappeared at the home of her parents. She said that she was not at
liberty to explain where she had been, but her mother induced her to
reveal this to a stone near the side-door, and taking up her station
behind the door heard all. She had been carried off by a robber; had
lived with him seven years, and borne him seven children. The robber,
who had otherwise treated her well, had refused to let her visit her
home, but finally had granted her this permission upon her promising
to say nothing about him. When the time arrived for her daughter to go
back, the mother gave her a bag of peas, which she was to drop one by
one along the way. She was kindly received, but presently the robber
thought there was something strange in her ways. He laid his head in
her lap, inviting her to perform the service so common in like cases.
While she was doing this, she could not but think how the robber
had loved her and how he was about to be betrayed by her, and her
remorseful tears dropped on his face. "So you have told of me!" cried
the astute robber, springing up. He cut off the children's heads and
strung them on a willow-twig before her eyes, and was now coming to
her, when people arrived, under the mother's conduct, who put a stop to
his further revenge, and took their own. See the note, Müllenhoff, p.

in the Zimmerische Chronik, ed. Barack, IV, 262-64, 1882, of Heinrich

1828, p. 321, communicated by W. Motherwell.</p>

<p><b>I.</b> 'The Douglas Tragedy,' 'Lord Douglas' Tragedy,' from an
old-looking stall-copy, without place or date.</p>

<p>This ballad was, therefore, not first given to the world by Mr Robert
Bell, in 1857, but nearly thirty years earlier by Motherwell, in the
single volume of the Paisley Magazine, a now somewhat scarce book. I
am indebted for the information and for a transcript to Mr Murdoch, of
Glasgow, and for a second copy to Mr Macmath, of Edinburgh.</p>

<p><a href="#Pg_1-96">96</a> a. Böðvar Bjarki, fighting with great effect as a huge bear for
Hrólfr Kraki, is obliged to return to his ordinary shape in consequence
of Hjalti, who misses the hero from the fight, mentioning his name:
Saga Hrólfs Kraka, c. 50, Fornaldar Sögur, I, 101 ff. In Hjálmtèrs
ok Ölvers Saga, c. 20, F. S. III, 506 f, Hörðr bids his comrades not
call him by name while he is fighting, in form of a sword-fish, with a
walrus, else he shall die. A prince, under the form of an ox, fighting
with a six-headed giant, loses much of his strength, and is nigh being
conquered, because a lad has, contrary to his prohibition, called him
by name. Asbjørnsen og Moe, Norske Folkeeventyr, 2d ed., p. 419. All
these are cited by Moe, in Nordisk Tidskrift, 1879, p. 286 f. Certain
kindly domestic spirits renounce relations with men, even matrimonial,
if their name becomes known: Mannhardt, Wald- und Feldkulte, I, 103.</p>

<p><a href="#Pg_1-97">97</a> b. Insert: <b>Spanish.</b> Milá, Romancerillo Catalan, 2d ed., No
206, <b>D</b>, p. 164: olivera y oliverá, which, when grown tall, join.</p>

<p><b>Servian.</b> Add: Karadshitch, I, 345, vv 225 ff, two pines, which
intertwine. In <b>I</b> 309, No 421, they plant a rose over the maid, a
vine over the man, which embrace as if they were Jani and Milenko. The
ballad has features of the Earl Brand class. (I, 239, No 341 == Talvj,
II, 85.)</p>

<p><b>Russian.</b> Hilferding, Onezhskya Byliny, col. 154, No 31, laburnum
(?) over Basil, and cypress over Sophia, which intertwine; col. 696, No
134, cypress and willow; col. 1242, No 285, willow and cypress.</p>

<p>Little Russian (Carpathian Russians in Hungary), Golovatsky, II, 710,
No 13: John on one side of the church, Annie on the other; rosemary on
his grave, a lily on hers, growing so high as to meet over the church.
Annie's mother cuts them down. John speaks from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-490" id="Pg_1-490">[Pg 490]</a></span> grave: Wicked
mother, thou wouldst not let us <i>live</i> together; let us rest together.
Golovatsky, I, 186, No 8: a maple from the man's grave, white birch
from the woman's, which mingle their leaves.</p>

<p><b>Slovenian.</b> &#352;túr, O národnich Písních a Pov&#277;stech Plemen
slovanských, p. 51: the lovers are buried east and west, a rose springs
from the man's grave, a lily from the maid's, which mingle their growth.</p>

<p><a href="#Pg_1-98">98</a> a. <b>Armenian.</b> The ashes of two lovers who have been literally
consumed by a mutual passion are deposited by sympathetic hands in one
grave. Two rose bushes rise from the grave and seek to intertwine,
but a thorn interposes and makes the union forever impossible. (The
thorn is <i>creed</i>. The young man was a Tatar, and his religion had been
an insuperable obstacle in the eyes of the maid's father.) Baron von
Haxthausen, Transkaukasia, I, 315 f. (Köhler.)</p>

<p>A Middle High German poem from a MS. of the end of the 14th century,
printed in Haupt's Zeitschrift, VI, makes a vine rise from the common
grave of Pyramus and Thisbe and descend into it again: p. 517. (Köhler.)</p>

<p>J. Grimm notes several instances of this marvel (not from ballads),

<p>Moravian, Su&#353;il, 'Ne&#353;t'astna svatba,' 'The Unhappy Wedding,' No
89, c, d, pp 85 f. A bridegroom is bringing home his bride; his sword
slips from the sheath and wounds the bride in the side. He binds up the
wound, and begs her to hold out till she comes to the house. The bride
can eat nothing, and dies in the night. Her mother comes in the morning
with loads of cloth and feathers, is put off when she asks for her
daughter, reproaches the bridegroom for having killed her; he pleads
his innocence.</p>

<p>Servian. Karadshitch, I, 309, No 421, 'Jani and Milenko,' belongs to
this class, though mixed with portions of at least one other ballad
('Earl Brand'). Milenko wooes the fair Jani, and is favored by her
mother and by all her brothers but the youngest. This brother goes
hunting, and bids Jani open to nobody while he is away, but Milenko
carries her off on his horse. As they are riding over a green hill,
a branch of a tree catches in Jani's dress. Milenko attempts to cut
the branch off with his knife, but in so doing wounds Jani in the
head. Jani binds up the wound, and they go on, and presently meet
the youngest brother, who hails Milenko, asks where he got the fair
maid, discovers the maid to be his sister, but bids her Godspeed. On
reaching his mother's house, Milenko asks that a bed may be prepared
for Jani, who is in need of repose. Jani dies in the night, Milenko
in the morning. They are buried in one grave; a rose is planted over
her, a grape-vine over him, and these intertwine, "as it were Jani with
Milenko."</p>

<p><a href="#Pg_1-143">143</a> b, after the first paragraph. A pallikar, who is bringing home his
bride, is detained on the way in consequence of his whole train leaving
him to go after a stag. The young man, who has never seen his bride's
face, reaches over his horse to give her a kiss; his knife disengages
itself and wounds her. She begs him to staunch the blood with his
handkerchief, praying only to live to see her bridegroom's house. This
wish is allowed her; she withdraws the handkerchief from the wound and
expires. Dozon, Chansons p. bulgares, 'Le baiser fatal,' p. 270, No 49.</p>

before him a glass of mead, and poison before the wife. God exchanges
them, and the son drinks the poison. The son makes his will. To his

<p><a href="#Pg_1-153">153</a> a. I failed to mention, though I had duly noted them, three
versions of 'L'Avvelenato,' which are cited by Professor D'Ancona in
his Poesia popolare Italiana, pp 106 ff.</p>

<p><b>D.</b> The Canon Lorenzo Panciatichi refers to the ballad in a
'Cicalata in lode della Padella e della Frittura,' recited at the
Crusca, September 24, 1656, and in such manner as shows that it was
well known. He quotes the first question of the mother, "Dove andastù
a cena," etc. To this the son answered, he says, that he had been
poisoned with a roast eel: and the mother asking what the lady had
cooked it in, the reply was, In the oil pot.</p>

<p><b>E.</b> A version obtained by D'Ancona from the singing of a young
fellow from near Pisa, of which the first four stanzas are given. Some
verses after these are lost, for the testament is said to supervene
immediately.</p>

<p><b>F.</b> A version from Lecco, which has the title, derived from
its burden, 'De lu cavalieri e figliu de re,' A. Trifone Nutricati
Briganti, Intorno ai Canti e Racconti popolari del Leccese p. 17. The
first four stanzas are cited, and it appears from these that the prince
had cooked the eel himself, and, appropriately, in a gold pan.</p>

<p><a href="#Pg_1-154">154</a> a, first paragraph. <b>F</b> is given by Meltzl, Acta
Comparationis, 1880, columns 143 f, in another dialect.</p>

<p><a href="#Pg_1-154">154</a> b. <b>Magyar.</b> The original of this ballad, 'A megétett János,'
'Poisoned John' (as would appear, in the Szekler idiom), was discovered
by the Unitarian bishop Kriza, of Klausenburg, and was published by
him in J. Arany's 'Koszoru,' in 1864. It is more exactly translated
by Meltzl in the Acta Comparationis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-499" id="Pg_1-499">[Pg 499]</a></span> Litterarum Universarum, 1880,
<span class="smcap">VII</span>, columns 30 f, the original immediately preceding. Aigner
has omitted the second stanza, and made the third into two, in his
translation. The Szekler has ten two-line stanzas, with the burden, Ah,
my bowels are on fire! Ah, make ready my bed! In the second stanza John
says he has eaten a four-footed crab; in the sixth he leaves his elder
brother his yoke of oxen; in the seventh he leaves his team of four
horses to his younger brother. Also translated in Ungarische Revue,
1883, p. 139, by G. Heinrich.</p>

<p><b>B</b>, another Szekler version, taken down by Meltzl from the mouth
of a girl, is in seven two-line stanzas, with the burden, Make my bed,
sweet mother! 'János,' Acta, cols 140 f, with a German translation.
John has been at his sister-in-law's, and had a stuffed chicken and
a big cake. At his elder sister's they gave him the back of the axe,
bloody stripes. He bequeaths to his elder sister remorse and sickness;
to his sister-in-law six oxen and his wagon; to his father illness and
poverty; to his mother kindness and beggary.</p>

the <i>bridegroom</i> jumps over the table, crying, Bachelor I came, and
bachelor will go.</p>

<p>The Epirots and Albanians have a custom of betrothing or marrying,
commonly in early youth, and of then parting for a long period. A woman
was lately (1875) buried at Iannina who, as the archbishop boasted in
the funeral discourse, had preserved her fidelity to a husband who had
been separated from her thirty years. This unhappy usage has given rise
to a distinct class of songs. Dozon, Chansons populaires bulgares, p.

<p><a href="#Pg_1-198">198</a> a, to first paragraph. For the marvellous transportation in these
stories, see a note by Liebrecht in Jahrbücher für rom. u. eng.
Literatur, III, 147. In the same, IV, 110, Liebrecht refers to the
legend of Hugh of Halton, recounted by Dugdale in his Antiquities of
Warwickshire, II, 646, ed. of 1730, and Monasticon Anglicanum, IV,
90 f, ed. 1823 (and perhaps in Dugdale's Baronage of England, but I
have not found it there). Hugo is another Gerard: the two half-rings
miraculously unite. (Köhler.) See, also, Landau on Torello, 'Der
Wunderritt,' Quellen des Dekameron 1884, pp 193-218.</p>

Littérature Orale de la Basse-Normandie, p. 268; E. Legrand, Romania,
X, 374, also from Normandy.</p>

<p>A ballad of the nature of 'Le Retour du Mari' is very popular in
Poland: Kolberg, No 22, pp 224 ff, some dozen copies; Wojcicki, I, 287;
Wojcicki, II, 311 == Kolberg's <b>c</b>; Lipinski, p. 159 == Kolberg's i;
Konopka, p. 121, No 20; Koz&#322;owski, No 5, p. 35, p. 36, two copies.
In Moravian, 'První milej&#353;í,' 'The First Love,' Su&#353;il, No 135,
p. 131. The general course of the story is that a young man has to go
to the war the day of his wedding or the day after. He commits his
bride to her mother, saying, Keep her for me seven years; and if I
do not then come back, give her to whom you please. He is gone seven
years, and, returning then, asks for his wife. She has just been given
to another. He asks for a fiddle [pipe], and says he will go to the
wedding. They advise him to stay away, for there will be a disturbance.
No, he will only stand at the door and play. The bride jumps over
four tables, and makes a courtesy to him on a fifth, welcomes him and
dismisses the new bridegroom.</p>

<p><a href="#Pg_1-199">199</a> a, end of the first paragraph. I forgot to mention the version of
Costantino, agreeing closely with Camarda's, in De Rada, Rapsodie d'un
poema albanese raccolte nelle colonie del Napoletano, pp 61-64.</p>

<p><a href="#Pg_1-200">200</a>. A maid, parting from her lover for three years, divides her ring
with him. He forgets, and prepares to marry another woman. She comes to
the nuptials, and is not known. She throws the half ring into a cup,
drinks, and hands the cup to him. He sees the half ring, and joins it
to his own. This is my wife, he says. She delivered me from death. He
annuls his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_1-503" id="Pg_1-503">[Pg 503]</a></span> marriage, and espouses the right woman. Miklosisch, Ueber
die Mundarten der Zigeuner, IV, Märchen u. Lieder, 15th Tale, pp 52-55,
at the end of a story of the class referred to at p. 401 f. (Köhler.)</p>

<p>A personage appeared at Magdeburg in 1348 in the disguise of a pilgrim,
asked for a cup of wine from the archbishop's table, and, in drinking,
dropped into the cup from his mouth the seal ring of the margrave
Waldemar, supposed to have been long dead, but whom he confessed or
avowed himself to be. Klöden, Diplomatische Geschichte des für falsch
erklärten Markgrafen Waldemar, p. 189 f. (Köhler.)</p>

<p>A wife who long pursues her husband, lost to her through spells,
drops a ring into his broth at the feast for his second marriage, is
recognized, and they are happily reunited: The Tale of the Hoodie,
Campbell, West Highland Tales, I, 63-66.</p>

<p>In a pretty Portuguese ballad, which has numerous parallels in other
languages, a long-absent husband, after tormenting his wife by telling
her that she is a widow, legitimates himself by saying, Where is your
half of the ring which we parted? Here is mine: 'Bella Infanta,'
Almeida-Garrett, II, 11, 14, Braga, Cantos p. do Archipelago Açoriano,
p. 300; 'Dona Infanta,' 'Dona Catherina,' Braga, Romanceiro Geral, pp 3

of tears to wash his feet, and dried his feet with her tresses. Then
she asked for a penance. She wished to go into a cave without door or

salt water; and this she did. In 'La Maddalena,' Guerrini, Alcuni C. p.

<p>I may note that Thomas Becket stands by his votaries when brought to
the gallows as effectually as St James. See Robertson, Materials, etc.,
I, 369, 471, 515, 524.</p>

<p><a href="#Pg_1-238">238</a>. Note <a href="#Footnote_1_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> should have been credited to R. Köhler.</p>

<p><a href="#Pg_1-238">238</a> b, second paragraph. Professor George Stephens informs me that the
miracle of the cock is depicted, among scenes from the life of Jesus,
on an <i>antependium</i> of an altar, derived from an old church in Slesvig,
and now in the Danish Museum. Behind a large table sits a crowned
woman, and at her left stands a crowned man, who points to a dish from
which a cock has started up, with beak wide open. At the queen's right
stands an old woman, simply clad and leaning on a staff. This picture
comes between the Magi announcing Christ's Birth and the Massacre of
the Innocents, and the crowned figures are judged by Professor Stephens
to be Herod and Herodias. Who the old woman should be it is not easy to
say, but there can be no connection with St James. The work is assigned
to the last part of the fourteenth century.</p>

<p><a href="#Pg_1-239">239</a>. Most of the literature on the topic of the restoration of the
roasted cock to life is collected by Dr R. Köhler and by Ferdinand
Wolf, in Jahrbücher für romanische u. englische Literatur, III, 58
ff, 67 f. Dr Köhler now adds these notes: The miracle of St James, in
Hermann von Fritslar's Heiligenleben, Pfeiffer's Deutsche Mystiker des
vierzehnten Jahrhunderts, I, 168 f; Hahn, Das alte Passional (from the
Golden Legend), p. 223, v. 47-p. 225, v. 85; Lütolf, Sagen, Bräuche und

ff, 656 f.</p>

<p><a href="#Pg_1-239">239</a> b. Three stone partridges on a buttress of a church at Mühlhausen
are thus accounted for. In the early days of the Reformation a couple
of orthodox divines, while waiting dinner, were discussing the prospect
of the infection spreading to their good city. One of them, growing
warm, declared that there was as much chance of that as of the three
partridges that were roasting in the kitchen taking flight from the
spit. Immediately there was heard a fluttering and a cooing in the
region of the kitchen, the three birds winged their way from the
house, and, lighting on the buttress of Mary Kirk, were instantly
turned to stone, and there they are. Thüringen und der Harz, mit ihren
Merkwürdigkeiten, u. s. w., VI, 20 f. (Köhler.)</p>

<p><a href="#Pg_1-240">240</a> a. The monk Andrius has the scene between Judas and his mother as
in Cursor Mundi, and attributes to Greek writers the opinion that the
roasted cock was the same that caused Peter's compunction. Mussafia,

<p>"About the year 1850 I was on a visit to the rector of Kilmeen, near
Clonakilty, in the county of Cork. My friend brought me to visit the
ruins of an old castle. Over the open fireplace, in the great hall
there was a stone, about two or three feet square, carved in the
rudest fashion, and evidently representing our Lord's sufferings.
There were the cross, the nails, the hammer, the scourge; but there
was one piece of sculpture which I could not understand. It was a sort
of rude semi-circle, the curve below and the diameter above, and at
the junction a figure intended to represent a bird. My friend asked me
what it meant. I confessed my ignorance. 'That,' said he, 'is the cock.
The servants were boiling him for supper, but when the moment came to
convict the <i>apostle</i> he started up, perched on the side of the pot,
and astonished the assembly by his salutation of the morning.'" Notes

<h4>25. Willie's Lyke-Wake.</h4>

<p>P. <a href="#Pg_1-247">247</a> b. Add: <b>E.</b> 'Willie's Lyke-Wake.' <b>a.</b> Buchan's
Ballads of the North of Scotland, II, 51. <b>b.</b> Christie,

<p><a href="#Pg_1-249">249</a> b. <b>Swedish.</b> Add: <b>D.</b> Aminson, Bidrag till

<p><b>French.</b> 'Le Soldat au Convent,' Victor Smith, Vielles Chansons
recueillies en Velay et en Forez, p. 24, No 21, or Romania, VII,
73; Fleury, Littérature Orale de la Basse Normandie, p. 310, 'La
Religieuse;' Poésies populaires de la France, III, fol. 289, fol.
297. A soldier who has been absent some years in the wars returns to
find his mistress in a convent; obtains permission to see her for
a last time, puts a ring on her finger, and then "falls dead." His
love insists on conducting his funeral; the lover returns to life and
carries her off.</p>

<p><a href="#Pg_1-249">249</a> b. <b>A. Magyar</b>. The ballad of 'Handsome Tony' is also
translated by G. Heinrich, in Ungarische Revue, 1883, p. 155.</p>

<p>The same story, perverted to tragedy at the end, in Golovatsky, II,
710, No 13, a ballad of the Carpathian Russians in Hungary.</p>

<p><a href="#Pg_1-250">250</a>. Dr R. Köhler points out to me a German copy of <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>,
<b>C</b>, which I had overlooked, in Schröer, Ein Ausflug nach
Gottschee, p. 266 ff, 'Hansel june.' The mother builds a mill and a
church, and then the young man feigns death, as before. But a very
cheap tragic turn is given to the conclusion when the young man springs
up and kisses his love. She falls dead with fright, and he declares
that since she has died for him he will die for her. So they are buried
severally at one and the other side of the church, and two lily stocks
are planted, which embrace "like two real married people;" or, a vine
grows from one and a flower from the other.</p>

<p><a href="#Pg_1-252">252</a>. This is the other form referred to at p. 247 a.</p>

<h4>28. Burd Ellen and Young Tamlane.</h4>

<p>P. <a href="#Pg_1-256">256</a>. This ballad is in Pitcairn's MSS, III, 49. It was from the
tradition of Mrs Gammel. The last word of the burden is Machey, not
May-hay, as in Maidment.</p>


<h4>29. The Boy and the Mantle.</h4>

<p>P. <a href="#Pg_1-270">270</a> b. If a girl takes a pot of boiling water off the fire, and
the pot ceases to boil, this is a sign of lost modesty. Lammert,
Volksmedizin und medizinischer Aberglaube in Bayern, u.s.w., p. 146.</p>


<h4>30. King Arthur and King Cornwall.</h4>

<p>P. <a href="#Pg_1-274">274</a>. A Galien in verse has been found in the library of Sir Thomas
Phillipps, at Cheltenham. Romania, XII, 5.</p>

Powell, Icelandic Legends, Second Series, 366, 'The Paunch.' Gorvömb,
a monstrous creature, in reward for great services, asks to have the
king's brother for husband, and in bed turns into a beautiful princess.
She had been suffering under the spells of a step-mother.</p>


<h4>39. Tam Lin.</h4>

<p>P. <a href="#Pg_1-335">335</a>. Add: <b>J.</b> 'Young Tamlane,' Kinloch MSS, V, 391.</p>

<p>335 a. The stanzas introduced into <b>I a</b> were from "Mr Beattie of
Meikledale's Tamlane," as appears from a letter of Scott to Laidlaw,
January 21, 1803. (W. Macmath.)</p>

même dans une légende bulgare en vers, saint Georges reçoit le même
service de la demoiselle exposée au dragon, dont il va la délivrer."
Dozon, Contes albanais, p. 27, note. In the Bulgarian legend referred
to, Bulgarski narodni p&#277;sni, by the brothers Miladinov, p. 31, the
saint having dozed off during the operation, the young maid sheds
tears, and a burning drop falls on the face of George, and wakes him.
This recalls the Magyar ballad, Molnár Anna, see p. 46. A Cretan legend
of St George has the same trait: Jeannaraki, p. 2, v. 41. Even a dead
lover recalled to the earth by his mistress, in ballads of the Lenore
